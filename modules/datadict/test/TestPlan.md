# Data Dictionary - Test Plan  

1. Check that you have access to the Data Dictionary if the user has one or more of these permissions: 
   data_dict, data_dict_edit or superuser.[Automation Testing]
2. Check that the instruments combo box contains all the instrument names.[Automation Testing]
3. Perform various searches and validate the results. Use any combination of the available search criteria. Make sure
   that when performing a keyword search the algorithm takes column Name, SourceField and Description into account. 
   Make sure that when you choose "Empty" in the Description combo box, all the rows returned have an empty description.

6. Check that pushing the Clear button sets the Description search field to 'All', the Instruments search field to
   'All instruments', clears the search keyword text field and performs a search with these criteria. Validate the
   results.

7. Check that if (and only if) you have the 'data_dict_edit' permission you can edit the Description field. Edit a
   description, access the Candidate Profile page and access the Data Dictionary page again. Make sure the edit was 
   saved.

8. Make sure that search keywords are not case-sensitive and that when you specify more than one keyword, the search
   returns entries that match the whole string.[Automation Testing] 
9. Check that you can navigate through the search result pages (both by clicking on the numbers and arrows in the
   bottom right corner of the table).

11. Check that the tools/data_dictionary_builder.php works. Try changing field names in an instrument before running the script and
    make sure that the corresponding entries in Data Dictionary are updated correctly.
