                                            Data Dictionary - Test Plan
                                            ===========================
                                            
1. Check that you have access to the Data Dictionary if the user has one or more of these permissions: 
   data_dict, data_dict_edit or superuser.
2. Check that the instruments combo box contains all the instrument names.
3. Perform various searches and validate the results. Use any combination of the available search criteria. Make sure
   that when performing a keyword search the algorithm takes column Name, SourceField and Description into account. 
   Make sure that when you choose "Empty" in the Description combo box, all the rows returned have an empty description.
4. Check that the table can be sorted according to any column (ascending and descending), except column 'No'.
5. Check that pushing the Clear button sets the Description search field to 'All', the Instruments search field to 
   'All instruments', clears the search keyword text field and performs a search with these criteria. Validate the
   results.
6. Check that if (and only if) you have the 'data_dict_edit' permission you can edit the Description field. Edit a 
   description, access the Candidate Profile page and access the Data Dictionary page again. Make sure the edit was 
   saved.
7. Check that you can navigate through the search result pages (both by clicking in the numbers and arrows in the 
   upper right corner of the table).
8. Make sure that search keywords are not case-sensitive and that when you specify more than one keyword, the search 
   returns entries that match the whole string.
