# Data Dictionary

This module houses definitions or descriptions for the data fields in instrument forms loaded in your LORIS.

Use the *Selection Filter* section to search for specific fields. Your results will be displayed in the data table below. 

Note that you can directly edit any cell in the *Description* column - this should be done with caution.
When a field description is modified, the new description is used in the Data Query Tool (after it is refreshed), by users who are selecting data fields to analyze or download. The modified field description will not be visible in the instrument form into which a user or survey participant enters data.
