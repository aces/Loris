# Data Dictionary

The Data Dictionary houses definitions or descriptions for instrument fields.

Use the Selection Filters and then click "Show Data" to search for and display specific fields.  Click "Clear Filters" to reset all search fields to begin a new search.  The Selection Filters panel can be hidden by clicking the upward arrow icon in the panel title bar, and re-expanded by clicking the downward arrow icon.  Sort data columns displayed in the results table in ascending or descending order by clicking on any column header.

Entries in the "Description" column may be modified. Click on each entry and directly edit the input field. An instrument field with a modified description will appear in the "Modified" filter results, and/or in the "Empty" filter results if the description is completely removed.
