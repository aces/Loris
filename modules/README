This directory contains any modules for Loris.

Modules should be entirely self-contained into a subdirectory with the following structure:
    ModuleName/
        ajax/         - This directory contains any AJAX helper script used by the module. They should
                        be invoked by using the AjaxHelper.php script in Loris
        css/          - Any necessary new CSS classes/files should go here
        js/           - This contains any javascript for the module. They are accessed with GetJS.php in
                        Loris, which does necessary permission checking and returns the file.
        php/          - This contains the NDB_Menu_Filter and/or NDB_Form for the module
        templates/    - Location of any smarty templates for your module
        tools/        - This contains any helper tools used either manually or by cron for this module

All of these directories are optional, and after a Menu_Filter is set up your module can
be accessed in a standard Loris fashion at main.php?test_name=ModuleName[&subtest=...]
