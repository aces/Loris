# Timepoint Instrument List

Once inside a time-point, users will see some general information about the candidate across the top of the screen, such as date of birth, sex, visit label, and subproject(cohort).

The blue sidebar panel contains key actions and flags to mark timepoint validity and completion status.  On mobile devices or in narrow browser windows, this sidebar panel is hidden but can be accessed by clicking the list icon in the top left-hand corner.

The sidebar shows the status of the visit can be viewed under "Stage:Visit"; here status can be updated to "Pass", "Failure", "Withdrawal", or "In Progress". After all instruments have completed data entry, a timepoint can be marked as Valid and "Complete".

Each timepoint is associated with a specific battery of tests or measures, also known as instruments. For any newly created timepoint, click "Start Next Stage" at the top of the sidebar to begin populating the behavioural battery for the candidate-timepoint.  No instruments will be visible within a timepoint until this step has been completed.

Once a timepoint is populated with instruments, the data table will list instrument name, status including Administration and Data Entry status, as well as whether any feedback notes exist for a particular instrument. Click on any instrument name to open the instrument form, to enter or view data.

If a study uses Double Data Entry forms to protect against user input errors and typos, the Double Data Entry (DDE) status will be displayed in the instrument list table. Double data entry can be performed by clicking on the "Double Data Entry" link for a given instrument.

To finalize data entry for a timepoint: in the sidebar under "Send Time Point" users must select "Send to DCC". After clicking "Send to DCC", no data entry changes can be made in the timepoint (including instruments) for this candidate. Users with the authorization to "Reverse Send to DCC" can make this timepoint editable after it has been finalized in this manner.

The "BVL QC Type" flag in the sidebar panel is used to record whether Behavioural Quality Control (QC) was done via visual inspection or based on detailed comparison with a paper hard copy.  The "BVL QC Status" flag records whether Quality Control has been reviewed and completed.
