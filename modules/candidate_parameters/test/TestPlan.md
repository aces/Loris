    * _candidate_parameter_view_ (_View Candidate Parameters_) permission (you should not be able to edit fields)
	* _candidate_parameter_edit_ (_Edit Candidate Parameters_) permission (you should be able to edit fields)
	* You need to belong to the same site as the candidate you are accessing, unless...
	* If you have _access_all_profiles_ you should be able to access all candidate profiles (even without candidate_parameters permissions)
2. Make sure that the candidate date of birth and sex in the table at the top of the page, match what is stored in the candidate table for this given candidate.
3. Click on the *Return to Timepoint List* button and ensure it goes to the correct timepoint list page.
4. Make sure all tabs render.

	* Reason for Caveat Emptor flag
	* Any other fields in `SELECT * FROM parameter_type WHERE ParameterTypeID IN (SELECT distinct(ptcr.ParameterTypeID) FROM parameter_type_category ptc JOIN parameter_type_category_rel ptcr USING (ParameterTypeCategoryID) WHERE ptc.NAME='Candidate Parameters');`
6. Change each field and click on *Update* and make sure it updates in the front-end and back-end.
7. If you set the *Caveat Emptor flag* to Yes, check that a reason must be specified. If the reason is set to 'Other', check that an explanation must be provided. If 'Other' does not exist as an option in the caveat_options table, the field should not show up in the front-end.
