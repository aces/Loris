# Candidate Parameters Test Plan

1. Check Permissions. Try removing each of these permissions/conditions one at a time. You should not be able to access the page
    * Edit Candidate Parameters
	* data_entry ("Data Entry", in front-end)
	* having the same site as the candidate you are accessing	
2. Make sure that the candidate date of birth and gender, shown in the table at the top of the page, match what is stored in the candidate table for this given candidate.

	* Comment
5. Click on update Candidate Info and make sure it takes you to the correct form for that candidate

### Update Candidate Info
6. For each field, change it and make sure that it saves when the "Save" button is clicked. Do each field one at a
time. You should still be able to save the Caveat Emptor Reason without the Caveat Emptor flag set because
abnormalities may be deemed satisfactory and the reason may be logged.

### Proband Information Panel
11. Check that the proband section only shows up if "show proband section..." is set to true in the configuration module.
12. Proband GUID, DoB Proband and Proband Gender should match what is stored in the candidate table. (Note: I don't even have Proband GUID in my table. It says "array" for this field on the module front-end. Perhaps it should take a different action.)
13. Check that the age difference in months between the candidate and proband is correct.
14. Remove the proband DoB. Check that the age difference field says that the age difference could not be calculated.
15. Click on Update Proband Info and make sure that it goes to the correct form for this candidate

### Update Proband Info
16. For each field, change it and make sure that it saves when the "Save" button is clicked. Do each field one at a time.
17. Try entering two different DoB and make sure an error appears if that is done.
18. Try entering only one DoB and make sure an error appears if that is done.

20. Check that the return candidate info button is working and that any changes you have made are now showing up.

22. Check that these family members match what can be found in the family table.
23. Click on the add family button and ensure that it takes you to the appropriate form.
24. Click on the DCCID and check that it takes you to the family members candidate profile.

### Add Family Info

26. Try changing the family member ID to an ID that does exist. Save without specifying the relationship type. An error should appear.

### Participation Consent Status Panel
35. Add a new consent type following [the guide](https://github.com/aces/Loris/wiki/Candidate-Information-Page) on the LORIS Wiki. Does it show up in this panel when you refresh the page?
36. Does the consent info shown in this table match what is stored in the participant_status table?

### Update Consent Info
37. Check that there is a set of form inputs for each type of consent. Does your new type of consent you just added appear here, with form inputs?
