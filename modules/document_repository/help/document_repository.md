The Document Repository is a useful tool that provides studies with a centralized location for important documents. Files may be uploaded and organized under any user-defined category. Subcategories can also be defined by the user to be nested under parent categories.
To view previously uploaded files, click on a given category title to reveal a complete list of subcategories, and then files organized within. Clicking on a filename in blue text will download the file. Users with appropriate permissions can click “Edit” to modify information associated with the file such as Category, Site, Instrument, PSCID, Visit Label, Comments, Version), or click "Delete" to remove the file.
