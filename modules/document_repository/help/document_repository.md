# Document Repository

This module provides studies with a centralized location for important documents. You can organize files by categories and subcategories designed by you or other members of your team.

In the **Browse** tab, you can search for specific files using the **Selection Filter** section. Click on any file name in the data table to download. Click on any of the folders to reveal subfolders and files organized within. You can click on **Edit** or **Delete** in any cell, in those respective columns, to modify a file. You can click on certain column headers to re-arrange the order of results in the table as desired.

Navigate to the **Upload** tab to upload a file. Populate the fields and upload your file. Your newly uploaded file should now appear in the list within the Browse tab.

If you need to add a new category or subcategory, you can do so in the **Category** tab. Populate the fields and click **Add Category**.
