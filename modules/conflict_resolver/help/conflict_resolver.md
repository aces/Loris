# Conflict Resolver

This module is designed to identify and resolve data conflicts in a study. LORIS uses double data entry, which means you may be asked to enter critical data twice in duplicate instrument forms. The Conflict Resolver will flag any discrepancies between the two entries (called *unresolved conflicts*) and allow you to fix—resolve—them easily. 

Conflicts are displayed in a table with two separate tabs—resolved and unresolved conflicts. By default, the module displays the *Unresolved Conflicts* tab. You can narrow this list of results using any combination of filters in the *Selection Filters* section. 

You can resolve all conflicts in the **Correct Answer** column of the resulting table. Click the drop-down to reveal two different responses—this is the conflict. These are two distinct values that were entered initially and during double data entry—they should be the same value. After cross-checking your data records for accuracy, select the correct response of the two. 

You can continue resolving conflicts in this list. To save your changes, click **Save** below the table. All saved, resolved conflicts will now appear in the *Resolved Conflicts* tab of the table.
