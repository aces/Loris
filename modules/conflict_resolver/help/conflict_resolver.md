# Conflict Resolver

The Conflict Resolver module enables studies to identify and resolve
typos and discrepancies that arise between initial data entry and double
data entry forms.

Unresolved and Resolved conflicts are displayed on two separate tabs of
the module. Unresolved conflicts are displayed by default upon accessing
the module. To access resolved conflicts, click on the “Resolved” tab.

Selection filters can be applied to search for a particular subject
and/or instrument. Click the “Clear Form” button to reset all
Selection Filters.

By default, unresolved data entry conflicts appear as “Unresolved”
under the “Correct Answer” column, until a user manually resolves
the data discrepancy. To resolve a conflict, click in the “Correct
Answer” column dropdown select for a given data entry item. This
dropdown-select will show two options: these are the data values that were
entered in each of the initial and the double data entry forms. Select
one of these options as the correct answer, after cross-checking against
original data records (e.g. paper forms) for accuracy. Changes are saved
automatically. Once a conflict is resolved a green check will appear
beside the input filed. If a red cross is displayed, the conflict could
not be saved (Your browser console log will display the error message.)

It is possible to chnage the resolved conflicts to a new value until
the page is refreshed. After refresh or when changing tab, the newly
resolved conflicts will appear in the “Resolved” tab.
