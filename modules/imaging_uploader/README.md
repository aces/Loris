# Imaging Uploader

## Purpose

The imaging uploader is intended to allow users to upload, browse, and track 
pipeline insertion progress.


## Intended Users

The primary users are MRI technicians or site coordinators uploading imaging 
scans for registered LORIS candidates and timepoints.

## Scope

The imaging uploader has the following built-in capabilities to facilitate 
timely scan insertion into the LORIS database. Specifically, it allows to browse
uploaded scans using the `Browse` tab, upload imaging scans using the `Upload` 
tab, and track scan insertion status through the `Progress` column and a 
`Log Viewer` which displays in either `Summary` or `Detailed` mode relevant 
feedback messages about insertion success or failure causes.

Uploaded scans can be overwritten if insertion status is `Not Started` or 
`Failed` (i.e. if the `Progress` is neither `In Progress` nor `Success`). 


NOT in scope:

The imaging uploader does NOT read the DICOM files within the uploaded scans. 
As such, it does not check if the files within the uploaded scan are of the 
expected DICOM type, nor whether the  PatientName and/or PatientID DICOM headers 
are properly de-identified according to the LORIS convention. This check is 
however done as the first step on the LORIS-MRI side; i.e. as soon as the 
insertion pipeline is triggered.

## Requirements

This module requires the use of another software package, [LORIS-MRI](https://github.com/aces/Loris-MRI). It consists of a series of scripts used for validation of image uploads.

For a successful upload:
- The CandID must exist in the database
- The PSCID must be valid for the CandID
- The Visit label must be valid for the CandID
- The candidate must be active in the database
- The session must be active in the database
- The uploaded file is expected to be of one of the following types: 
`.tgz`, `.tar.gz` or `.zip`.
- The file should not exceed the max upload size
- The filename should follow the:
`PSCID_CandID_VisitLabel_OptionalSuffix` naming convention

## Permissions

#### Module Permission

*In the interest of backward compatibility, permission behaviour varies slightly 
based on the `useAdvancedPermissions` configuration*

Any of the following permissions grants access to the module.

`imaging_uploader_allsites`: 
 - If `useAdvancedPermissions` is disabled, this permission gives access 
 to all Uploads in the database (backward compatible with projects not requiring a 
 session ID to be defined).
 - If `useAdvancedPermissions` is enabled, this permission gives access to 
 all Uploads as long as they are associated to a session and the session is affiliated
 to a project that the user is affiliated with. When combined with `imaging_uploader_nosessionid`, 
 user gets access to their projects' data as well as Uploads with no session ID associated.

`imaging_uploader_ownsites`: 
 - If `useAdvancedPermissions` is disabled, this permission gives access 
 to Uploads for sites that the user is affiliated with (regardless of the project). 
 When combined with `imaging_uploader_nosessionid`, user gets access to their sites' 
 data as well as Uploads with no session ID associated.
 - If `useAdvancedPermissions` is enabled, this permission gives access to 
 all Uploads for sites and projects that the user is affiliated with. 
 When combined with `imaging_uploader_nosessionid`, user gets access to their projects' 
 and sites' data as well as Uploads with no session ID associated.

Note that if you have access to the module, you will always see files uploaded for 
your own user regardless of their site and project affiliation.

#### Filesystem Permission

The path on the filesystem where the uploaded file go 
(see section [Database Configuration](#database_config_link)) should be 
readable and writable by the web server. This is automatically achieved by the 
LORIS-MRI install process.


## Configurations

The imaging uploader has the following configurations that affect its usage:

### LORIS-MRI

The imaging insertion pipelines and libraries in the Loris-MRI repo must be installed, configured, and tested before imaging data can be loaded into LORIS via this module. Please visit
[the documentation for LORIS-MRI](https://github.com/aces/Loris-MRI#installation) 
for more information.

### Install Configurations

To enable the Imaging Uploader to handle large files, please follow the
instructons for [Handling Large File Uploads](../../docs/wiki/00_SERVER_INSTALL_AND_CONFIGURATION/02_Website_Configuration/Handling_Large_File_Uploads.md).

#### <a name="database_config_link"></a> Database Configurations

ImagingUploaderAutoLaunch - This setting determines whether the insertion 
        pipeline that archives the scans is triggered automatically or manually.

MRIUploadIncomingPath - This setting determines where on the filesystem the 
        uploader is to place the uploaded scan. Default location is 
        `/data/incoming/`. This directory is created during the installation of 
        LORIS-MRI. 
        **Note**: Uploaded scans are erased from the 
        `MRIUploadIncomingPath`following a successful archival and insertion 
        through the LORIS-MRI pipeline. 

The `useAdvancedPermissions` configuration enables more advanced Site and 
Project access control (Although Site permissions are enabled without this 
configuration, "all sites" gives access to data with no Session ID if this 
configuration is turned off). If enabled, users accessing the module can only see 
data where a session ID has been found and are thus linked to the site and project 
of the session AND the site and project match the user's. Access to data with no 
session is granted by the `imaging_uploader_nosessionid` permission (see permissions section)


## Interactions with LORIS

- The `TarchiveInfo` column links to the DICOM Archive module for that scan
- The `Number of MincInserted` column links to the Imaging Browser module for 
that candidate's session 
- The `Number of MincCreated` column links to the MRI Violated scans module if
violated scans (i.e. scans that violate the MRI protocol as defined by the 
study) are present
- If `ImagingUploaderAutoLaunch` configuration is enabled, the Server Process
Manager under the Admin menu can be consulted for scans insertion progress 
(exit codes, error files, etc...).
