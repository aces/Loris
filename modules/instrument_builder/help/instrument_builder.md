# Instrument Builder

The Instrument Builder module is designed to create new behavioural forms on the database. Existing instruments that were created using the instrument builder can be added under the "Load Instrument (optional)" heading. Most new instruments will be generated through the "Create Instrument" tab.

There are a series of buttons that specify the type of information each field in the form conveys.

Field Types, by Category :

<u>Information</u>

  • Header :: Used to specify a title for the page or section of the instrument. Text will appear in boldface at the center of the page.

  • Label :: Functions as a subtitle to introduce a subset of questions

  • Scored Field :: Specifies any field that will have data entry. The type of scored field should be indicated under the "data entry" section

<u>Data Entry</u>

• Textbox :: Used for fields with free text, preferably short answers\

• Textarea :: Used for free text fields with longer inputs such as general comments, etc.

• Dropdown :: Used for forced choice fields. The options for the dropdown menu need to be specified.  Once "Dropdown" is selected, the user will see an added row labeled as "Dropdown option". Once the option has been entered, press "add option". This new option should appear in the "preview" menu. The field "not_answered" will be automatically added to each dropdown menu. Once all options have been added, click "add row". For subsequent dropdown scored fields, previous dropdown options will be preserved. If the user would like to create a new dropdown menu, click "reset".

• Multiselect :: Used for fields that have a select box where multiple options can be chosen.

• Date :: Used for creating a date field such as Date of Birth

• Numeric :: Used for creating a numeric field such as Height, Weight, etc.

<u>Formatting</u>

• Blank Line :: Can be used to separate sections within the same page of an instrument. The "Question Name" and "Question Text" can be left blank.

• Page Break :: Used to add a new page within the instrument. The "Question Text" can be populated with the name of the new page, if desired.

**Note on Question Names: **
"Question Name" is the field name as it appears (only) in the back-end of the database. The "Question Text" will be seen by users on the database once the instrument has been uploaded. Users have the option of entering the same content into both the "Question Name" and "Question Text" boxes, but generally the "Question Name" is more brief and is formatted with the question number (ie. q9_short_name). Question names are unique and should not contain spaces. 

After each question entry, click "add row" to add the new field to the instrument code.

This should appear in table format at the bottom of the page. Each row can also be added to the table simply by pressing the enter key.

If a mistake was made while creating the instrument, users can directly edit the field names in the table at the bottom of the page. By clicking on the field name, a cursor should appear. The user can then make the appropriate changes and hit enter once finished. It is also possible to rearrange or delete fields using the "Options" column.

Once the user is satisfied with their instrument, it can be saved and validated.
