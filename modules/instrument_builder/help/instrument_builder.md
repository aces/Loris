# Instrument Builder

This module allows you to create new behavioural forms in your LORIS database.

If you have existing instruments that were created using the instrument builder, add them into the database in the **Load** tab. Browse for the instrument in question and click **Load Instrument**.

If you need to create a new instrument, navigate to the **Build** tab. Use the fields and dropdown menus provided to build out the questions for your new instrument. Click **Add Row** to add each question, which should then appear in the table above. Click **Edit** or **Delete** to modify your question once its been added. Any question you add during this process will be associated with the same instrument. 

Once you have added all of the questions for this instrument, navigate to the **Save** tab. Populate the fields and click **Save**.
