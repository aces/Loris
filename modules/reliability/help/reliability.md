# Reliability

## Purpose

The Reliability module enables studies to track cross-site and long-term
 reliability of clinician-scored assessments.  For multi-site studies 
requiring inter-rater agreement in instrument scoring, this tool provides
 transparency in ongoing data collection. The Reliability module immediately
 highlights any discrepancies in instrument administration or data reports.
Selection Filters in the module can be applied to view reliability 
assessments on candidate data records of interest.

Once a search has been conducted, a list of entries will appear listing
 candidates by PSCID, the site of reliability, cohort, “DCCID”, gender, 
“Visit Label”, “Instrument”, reliability score, and finally whether the 
reliability score surpasses the accepted threshold (Yes in green,
 or No in red). Click on any column header to sort the data table;
 clicking more than once will toggle between ascending and descending 
sort order.  If the candidate data had been flagged as invalid, the user 
will see a note in red text beside the “PSCID”.

On a narrow browser window or mobile device, the data table will show 
arrows on each side for easy scrolling. Selection Filters and other panels
 above the data table can be hidden by clicking the upward arrow in the 
top right panel corner.

## Swap Candidates 

Candidates are selected for reliability assessment at random by the 
database. For candidates lacking adequate data for reliability 
assessment (e.g. poor quality video for a given instrument), 
a different candidate can be manually selected using the 
"Swap Candidates" feature.

Click the downward arrow in the “Swap Candidates” panel title bar to view or 
use this feature. Input the "Original Candidate" selected (with inadequate 
data), and then input the desired "Replacement Candidate". Select the 
instrument in question and proceed by clicking the "Swap Candidates" button.

For each instrument undergoing reliability assessment, the data table lists 
the reliability status of each rater (e.g. "Yes" or "In progress"), as well 
as the date at which reliability was established, date at which the tape was 
sent, date at which Feedback was received, whether the rater is outside the 
research group and Administration status ("Current" or "No"). The criteria 
required for reliability is outlined under the heading of each instrument.

## Entering Reliability Data

After clicking on the “PSCID” of a candidate (in blue text) from the results 
table, a data entry page will appear for second raters to enter data for the 
selected candidate and instrument. LORIS will automatically compare the 
second rater’s entries against the first rater, to calculate a reliability 
score. This score will appear in the main Reliability page under the 
"Reliability Score" Column.
To view the instrument data entry form, click on the “Comment ID” link in blue 
text under "Scoring".

## After Saving Reliability Form

All saved data is displayed, and is unmodifiable in this page. Return to
 the Reliability module main page via the Clinical Menu.
