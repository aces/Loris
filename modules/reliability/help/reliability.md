# Reliability

The Reliability module enables studies to track cross-site and long-term reliability of clinician-scored assessments.  For multi-site studies requiring inter-rater agreement in instrument scoring, this tool provides transparency in ongoing data collection. The Reliability module immediately highlights any discrepancies in instrument administration or data reports.
Selection Filters in the module can be applied to view reliability assessments on candidate data records of interest.

Once a search has been conducted, a list of entries will appear listing candidates by PSCID, the site of reliability, cohort, “DCCID”, gender, “Visit Label”, “Instrument”, reliability score, and finally whether the reliability score surpasses the accepted threshold (Yes in green, or No in red). Click on any column header to sort the data table; clicking more than once will toggle between ascending and descending sort order.  If the candidate data had been flagged as invalid, the user will see a note in red text beside the “PSCID”.

On a narrow browser window or mobile device, the data table will show arrows on each side for easy scrolling. Selection Filters and other panels above the data table can be hidden by clicking the upward arrow in the top right panel corner.

** Swap Candidates **
Candidates are selected for reliability assessment at random by the database. For candidates lacking adequate data for reliability assessment (e.g. poor quality video for a given instrument), a different candidate can be manually selected using the "Swap Candidates" feature.
Click the downward arrow in the “Swap Candidates” panel title bar to view or use this feature. Input the "Original Candidate" selected (with inadequate data), and then input the desired "Replacement Candidate". Select the instrument in question and proceed by clicking the "Swap Candidates" button.

For each instrument undergoing reliability assessment, the data table lists the reliability status of each rater (e.g. "Yes" or "In progress"), as well as the date at which reliability was established, date at which the tape was sent, date at which Feedback was received, whether the rater is outside the research group and Administration status ("Current" or "No"). The criteria required for reliability is outlined under the heading of each instrument.

** Entering Reliability Data **
After clicking on the “PSCID” of a candidate (in blue text) from the results table, a data entry page will appear for second raters to enter data for the selected candidate and instrument. LORIS will automatically compare the second rater’s entries against the first rater, to calculate a reliability score. This score will appear in the main Reliability page under the "Reliability Score" Column.
To view the instrument data entry form, click on the “Comment ID” link in blue text under "Scoring".

** After saving Reliability form **
All saved data is displayed, and is unmodifiable in this page. Return to the Reliability module main page via the Clinical Menu.
