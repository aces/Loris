# Publication

Publication is intended for users to propose specific research projects
and for PIs to review them. When proposing a project, PIs may also specify 
other users for help with editing and maintaining their project proposals. Only users that are affiliated with the proposal can delete publications.



Navigate to the "__Propose a Project__" tab for proposing research projects based on the data required. You may upload publication media which may then be reviewed by study PIs.

You should specify which specific variables of interest are relevant to your research so that the reviewers can determine if they should grant access to the data.
