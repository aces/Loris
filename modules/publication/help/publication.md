# Publication

This module allows you (or a PI) to review and propose specific research projects. 

In the **Browse** tab, use the selection filters to search for a project of interest. 

You can propose a project in the **Propose a Project** tab. Populate the fields, paying special attention to user permissions. Only users that are affiliated with the proposal can delete publications. You can upload a file to be associated with the publication. 

You should also make sure to specify which variables of interest are relevant to your research, so reviewers can properly determine if they should grant access to the data.
