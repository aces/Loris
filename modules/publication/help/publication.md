# Publication

Publication is intended for users to propose specific research projects
and for PIs to review them. When proposing a project, PIs may also specify 
other users to help with editing and maintaining their project proposals.


Navigate to the "__Propose a Project__" tab for proposing research projects based on the data required. You may upload publication media, and allows study PIs to review the project 
proposals.

Specify which specific variables of 
interest that are relevant to the research. Gathering and releasing this 
data remains within the scope of the DQT and Data Release modules respectively.

Remember the Publication module is intended solely for tracking the status and metadata of the proposals, as well as 
storing the resulting publication media. Only users that are affiliated with the proposal can delete publications.
