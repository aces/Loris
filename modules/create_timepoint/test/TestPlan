Create Timepoint Test Plan:

1. Access a candidate that does not have all timepoints from project created
   from Access Profile and click "Create time point"
2. Choose a subproject from dropdown.
   Ensure that page reloads with subproject selected and also a list of visit
   labels if <labelSet> is set in the config.xml and a textbox otherwise.
3. If visit label is a textbox, ensure that an error appears if the <regex>
   specified in the config file does not pass.
4. Ensure that an error appears if the visit label already exists for the
   candidate.
5. Click create time point without choosing visit. Ensure there's an error.
6. Choose visit label to be created and click "Create Time Point".
   Ensure that you get a page saying creation was successful.
   Click on "Click here to continue" link and ensure that it brings you back
   to timepoint list page for that candidate (with new timepoint created)
7. Repeat the steps above after creating a New Candidate.
8. Check that page is inaccessible if either the user does not have data_entry
   permission or the user and candidate are not the same site.
