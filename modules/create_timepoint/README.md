# Create Timepoint

## Purpose

The create timepoint module is intended to allow the creation of
timepoints (also sometimes called "sessions" or "visits") for
candidates within a LORIS module.

## Intended Users

The `create_timepoint` module is primarily used by data entry staff
in order to create a new session prior to data entry. It may also
be used by imaging staff in order to create a timepoint before
uploading scans.

## Scope

The `create_timepoint` only creates the timepoint. It does not
populate the test battery (which is done by the `next_stage` module.)

## Permissions

The module requires the user to have the `data_entry` permission
as well as at least 1 study site.

## Configurations

The "visitLabel" setting in config.xml determines how the visit
label for the timepoint is selected. However, this functionality
is deprecated as text entry is unreliable.

## Interactions with LORIS

Users primarily access this module from the `candidate_list`. Upon
creating a timepoint, the module provides a link to the (empty)
`instrument list` module for the new timepoint.
