# Create Timepoint

To add a new timepoint, select the *Subproject* for this visit, which will reveal new fields. Select the appropriate *Site*, *Project*, and *Visit Label*. Then, click **Create Timepoint** to register this timepoint. You should see a success message, including a clickable link that says “Click here to continue.”

Note: after creating a new timepoint, you will return to the _Timepoint List_ page. Click on the new visit in the table, and then in the next page, click on **Start Visit Stage** in the left sidebar to specify the visit date, which will automatically  add instruments to this timepoint based on the appropriate behavioural battery of tests.
