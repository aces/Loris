# API documentation module

This module uses [Swagger-UI](https://swagger.io/tools/swagger-ui/) to present 
this LORIS instance modules API endpoints. By selecting a module name in the 
*Select  a spec* dropdown, it will provide a description of each of the selected 
module's endpoints.

You can use the *Try it out* button to test each endpoint. (Note that this will 
send a real API request which may affect your data.)

**NOTE:**  
If accessing this module as a guest (Unauthenticated user), you will have to 
authenticate yourself before using most of the endpoints. To do so, select the
**api** spec, then use the login endpoint *Try it out*. You will have to fill 
the *Request body* section with the appropriate credentials then hit the *Execute* 
button. If successful, the *Response* section will contain the JWT token to put 
in the *Value* field when clicking the *Authorize* button. The token value must 
be prefixed with the word "Bearer".
