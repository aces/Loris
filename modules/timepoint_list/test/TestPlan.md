1. Access a candidate and ensure correct visits shown and links point to
   correct place.
2. Ensure that (access_all_profiles permissions is required) OR (if user and candidate are the same site)
    data_entry permissions is NOT required 
3. Ensure create timepoint link points to correct place
4. Ensure candidate_info link points to correct place
5. If candidate_parameters_edit, candidate_info button should read "Edit Candidate Info". If candidate_parameters_view, button should read "View Candidate Info".
