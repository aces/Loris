# Candidate Profile

LORIS organizes longitudinal study data into a series of timepoints (visit) for each candidate. Each timepoint will be identified by a **Visit Label** (i.e. V1, V2), according to the testing plan or battery design of the study.

## Timepoint List

The data table lists all registered time-points, displaying summary status information about each. Click on any **Visit Label** to open a timepoint record and view all instruments and data collected at that candidate-timepoint.

There are several actions you can take within a candidate's profile from the *Candidate Profile* page. This includes creating new timepoints, editing the candidate's information, and viewing imaging datasets.

## Create New Timepoint

Click **Create New Timepoint**, which brings you to a new page, which has its own help text with instructions for creating a new timepoint.

## Candidate Info

Click **Candidate Info** to arrive at the *Candidate Parameters* page, where you can edit general information about the candidate, such as adding their consent. 

## View Imaging Datasets

Click **View Imaging Datasets** to view the scans collected for the candidate's timepoints in the Imaging Browser.
