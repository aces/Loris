    Series Description or Scan Type, Time Run, Type of Problem, SeriesUID
    [Manual Testing]
3.  Filter for scans that violate MRI Protocol violation (For each type of Problem : Could not identify scan type, Visit Label does not exist, MRI Protocol Check Violation, Candidate mismatch)
    Ensure link under Problem column goes to MRI Protocol Violations page with correct scan information 
    set in the filters, and parameters showing when could not identify scan type, or MRI Protocol Check Violation are the type of problem
    [Manual Testing]
4.  MRI Protocol Violations page check Selection Filter results for each of DCCID, PSCID, PatientName, SeriesUID,
    Time Run, Series Description
    [Automation Testing]
5.  MRI Protocol Violations page - ensure first table displays all valid protocols
    for the study
    [Manual Testing]
6.  MRI Protocol Violations page - displays header information of violated scan
    [Manual Testing]

11. MRI Protocol Check violation page - click on link under PatientName column, should go to Dicom Archive for the
    patient if permission 'Across all sites view Dicom Archive modile and pages' is granted
    [Manual Testing]
12. Upload scan that violates protocol and ensure it shows up in the module
    [Manual Testing]
13. Upload scan that violates protocol check and ensure it shows up in the module
    [Manual Testing]
14. Resolve issues with each of the different types of resolutions, and ensure that they show up in the resolved tab, and are no longer in the unresolved tab
    [Manual Testing]
15. Ensure that the link to the protocol violation works within the resolved tab
