# MRI Violated Scans

This module displays scans that have been flagged for significant variance from the study protocol. Use the *Selection Filter* section to narrow down your search in the data results table below. 

The table contains two tabs: **Not Resolved** and **Resolved**. When a scan is updated to any status other than *Unresolved*, it will move to the **Resolved** tab. You must manually update the status of each *Unresolved* scan, when relevant.

You can click the link in the *MincFile* column to view the scan in BrainBrowser. Click **Protocol Violation** in the *Problem* column to view details of the protocol violations issue.

If you click on the link for any scan of problem type "Could not identify scan type" or "Protocol violation" the module will
display a popup with the details of any problems for that SeriesUID.
