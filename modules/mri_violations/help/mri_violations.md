# MRI Violated Scans

This module displays scans that have been flagged for significant variance from the study protocol. Use the *Selection Filter* section to narrow down your search in the data results table below. 

The table contains two tabs: **Not Resolved** and **Resolved**. When a scan is updated to any status other than *Unresolved*, it will move to the **Resolved** tab. You must manually update the status of each *Unresolved* scan, when relevant.

You can click the link in the *MincFile* column to view the scan in BrainBrowser. Click **Protocol Violation** in the *Problem* column to view details of the protocol violations issue.
