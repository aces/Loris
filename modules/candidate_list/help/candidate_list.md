# Access Profile

This module is used to search for an existing candidate and their related data. 

You can search for a specific candidate using any of the filter options in the *Selection Filter* section. If necessary, click **Show Advanced Filters** to search using additional filters. Your matching candidate(s) will appear automatically in the table below as you populate the filter fields. Depending on how many filters you use, you may have multiple candidates appear in the table. For example, if you only enter a DCCID, any candidate with that ID will appear in the table. 

Click on any PSCID in the table to access more detailed information on that specific candidate, or to create a visit time point to associate with their profile.
