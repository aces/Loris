# Access Profile

This module is used to search for an existing candidate and their related data. 

You can search for a specific candidate using any of the filter options in the *Selection Filter* section. If necessary, click **Show Advanced Filters** to search using additional filters. Your matching candidate(s) will appear automatically in the table below as you populate the filter fields. Depending on how many filters you use, you may have multiple candidates appear in the table. For example, if you only enter a site, any candidate associated with that site will appear in the table. Notice that partial matches will begin to appear in the table as you type in the fields. For example, if you start typing a DCCID such as *MTL001*, all matches that begin with MTL001 will appear in the table (i.e. MTL0010, MTL0011, MTL0012, etc.)

Click on any PSCID in the table to access more detailed information on that specific candidate, or to create a time-point to associate with their profile.
