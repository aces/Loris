# Access Profile

This module is used to search for an existing candidate and their related data. 

You can search for a specific candidate using any of the filter options in the *Selection Filter* section. Click **Show Advanced Filters** to enter additional criteria. 

Your matching candidate(s) will appear automatically in the table below as you start to populate the filter fields, including partial matches on what you are currently typing.

For example, if you start typing a PSCID such as *MTL001*, all matches containing "MTL001" will appear in the table - including _MTL0010_, _MTL0011_, _MTL0012_ etc.

Click on any PSCID in the table to access the _Candidate Profile_ with more information on a specific candidate, and to create a time-point to associate with their profile.
