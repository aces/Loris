# Statistics

This module calculates and displays summary numbers on data acquisition, data processing, and data entry for both behavioural and imaging data collections in LORIS. 

The module is comprised of 3 sections: Demographic Statistics, Behavioral Statistics, and Imaging Statistics. You can view a description of each under the **General Description** tab. 

## Demographic Statistics

In the **General Demographic Statistics** table, you can view population breakdowns by site or project. Use the drop-down filters to narrow your search and click on **Submit Query**.

## Behavioural Statistics

The **Data Entry Statistics** table displays a count of completed visits for each site, per visit label. Note that *Completed* refers to instruments marked as *”Data Entry = Complete”* and *“Administration = All”*.

Click on **View Details** in any of the columns to view a complete list of statistics at that site. Then, click on any of the data strings in the table (links in blue text) to display specific stats for that site, visit, and instrument. 

The **Double Data Entry Statistics** table below displays similar breakdowns, but for Double Data entry form completion.

## Imaging Statistics

This tab displays two tables:

The *General Statistics with QC Status* first table displays the number of scans that have been inserted for each scan type, along with their QC status. You can customize the scan types that you want to view in the table using the checkboxes above the table. You can also view only specific sites or projects using the dropdown menus provided. Click **Submit Query** to apply any customizations to the data table.

The *Breakdown by Scan Type* table provides a more detailed breakdown of statistics by scan type, based on the MRI Parameter Form data. Select a scan type from the dropdown menu, check **Show Visit Labels** if desired, and click **Submit Query**.
