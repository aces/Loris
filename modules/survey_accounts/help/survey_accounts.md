# Survey Accounts

The Survey Accounts Module can be used to create a survey form, which creates a unique URL that can either be emailed to the participants to be completed online or loaded as a webpage on a desktop at the site for the participants to fill out during their visit.
 This page contains a list of all forms created for direct data entry by study participants. You can filter this list of surveys based on the Visit, Email, PSCID and Instrument. 
 To create a survey, click on the "Add Survey" button. See additional help on the "Add Survey" page for information on how to create a survey. Once the survey has been created, click on the URL to access the online survey.
 Survey Status Information:
Created: Indicates that the survey was created. This is the default status once a survey is created using the "Add Survey" page.
 Sent: Indicates that the survey was created and an email with the survey link was sent to the participant. This is the default status once a survey is created and sent by email using the "Add Survey" window. 
 In Progress: indicates that the survey was accessed. This status can either be attained when data entry staff click on the URL to load the page for the participants or when participants access the link sent to them via email. 
 Complete: This indicates that the survey was completed and submitted. After this stage, the participant will not be able to go back and change his/her entries. Clicking on the URL will display a page with the message "Data has already been submitted".
