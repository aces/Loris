    enter in a message and make sure it sends (also try the cancel button on this page).
    The email can be pre-populated for each instrument using participant_emails table.
    * Ensure that the instrument being sent is what you get (and that the URL brings you to the correct survey).
    * Use the `Create Survey` button (no email address should be specified).
    * Use the `Email survey` button by specifying email address.
    * Check that the survey list shows the newly created survey with all the correct information.
