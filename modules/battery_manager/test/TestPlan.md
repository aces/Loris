  2. By default, the access to module should be denied.

**Testing with view permission** [Automation Testing]
  1. Add view permission to the aforementioned user.
  2. Battery Manager module should be accessible and only present with **one** tab (Browse).
  3. The **Deactivate** column should not be in the data table.

**Testing with edit permission** [Automation Testing]
  1. Add edit permission.
  2. Battery Manager module should now have **two** tabs (Browse) and (Add).
  3. The **Deactivate** should be in the data table.
  4. Clicking on Add tab should hide the data table and display a form with the following fields:
     Instrument, Minimum age, Maximum age, Stage, Subproject, Visit Label, Site, First Visit,
     and Instrument Order.

     - You should only be able to enter a number in between 0 and 127 for Instrument Order.
  4. Check that when you try to add an entry that has an active duplicate in the table (Active = 'Y'), you receive an error message.
  5. Check that when you try to add an entry that has an inactive duplicate in the table (Active = 'N'), you receive a warning message that allows you to activate the duplicate.
     - Make sure that when you press "Yes", a success message appears and the page goes back to the Browse tab.
     - Make sure the entry you just activated is activated in the data table.

     - Make sure the entry you just added is shown in data table.

**Testing browse functionality**
  1. After a couple of entries are added, make sure they are properly displayed in the data table.
  2. Make sure that information in the data table corresponds to the information in the `test_battery` table.
  3. Click on ðŸ‘‰  **column headers**  to make sure sorting functionality is working as expected (Ascending/Descending).

**Testing deactivate functionality**
  1. Press "Deactivate" in **Deactivate** column on an entry in the data table to deactivate it in the `test_battery` table.
  2. Check that a warning message appears that asks you if you want to deactivate the entry.
     - Make sure that when you press "Yes", a success message appears and the page refreshes.
     - Make sure the entry you just deactivated is deactivated in the data table.

**Test filters**
  1. Under **Browse** tab, a selection filter should be present on top of the page containing the following fields:
Instrument, Minimum age, Maximum age, Stage, Subproject, Visit Label, Site, First Visit, Instrument Order, Active.
    - Minimum age, Maximum age, and Instrument Order are text fields.
    - Other fields are dropdowns with options pre-filled based on the current project.
    - Default option of dropdown should be blank.
  2. Type text in the Minimum age and verify that the table gets filtered as you type.
  3. Type text in the Maximum age and verify that the table gets filtered as you type.
  4. Select values from the dropdown filters (independently and combined) to filter table further.
