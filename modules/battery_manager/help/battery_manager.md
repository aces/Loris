# Battery Manager

The Battery Manager module serves as a front-end for searching for, adding, activating, and deactivating entries in the Test Battery.

## Searching for an entry in the Test Battery

Under the Browse tab, use the Selection Filters to search for files by fields such 
as Instrument, Minimum age, Maximum age, Stage, Subproject, Visit Label,
Site, First Visit, Instrument Order, and Active. As filters are selected, the data table below will
dynamically update with relevant results. Click the “Clear Filters”
button to reset all filters.

Within the data table, results can be sorted in ascending or descending order by 
clicking on any column header.

## Adding an entry to the Test Battery

Under the “Add” tab, users will be able to add a new entry to the Test Battery.
Users must specify information about the entry by:
- Selecting from a number of dropdown menus including Instrument, Stage, Subproject, Visit Label, and First Visit
- Filling in numeric text fields including Minimum Age, Maximum Age, and Instrument Order and searchable dropdown Site
- Pressing the **Add entry** button to insert the entry into the Test Battery

## Activating an entry in the Test Battery

Under the “Add” tab, users will not be able to add a new entry if it already exists in the Test Battery and it is active.
However, if the duplicate in the Test Battery is inactive, a pop up will appear after the **Add entry** button is pressed that will give the user the option to activate the duplicate.

## Deactivating an entry in the Test Battery

Click the **Deactivate** button in the “Deactivate” column to deactivate the entry in the Database and the Menu Table.

This page does not allow users to modify field values other than "Active" in an entry in the Test Battery.
