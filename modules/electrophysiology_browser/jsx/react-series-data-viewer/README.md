## <a name="user-manual"></a> User manual

The EEG Browser visualization component adds support for some useful visual helpers: The **Signal Viewer** and the **Electrode Map**.

![Overall View](./../../images/overall-view.png)

### Signal Viewer
![Signal Viewer](./../../images/signal-values-details.png) <br/><br/>
Several tools can be used to navigate through the Signal Viewer:
 - The **Timeline Range View** (1) can be used to change the boundaries of the viewed timeline.
 - The **Amplitude** and **Filter** tools (2) can be used to increase/reduce the amplitude scale and apply high or low-pass filters.
 - The **Channel navigation** (3) can be used to navigate through the viewed channels.
 - The **Event Panel** (4) can be used to display information about the events when event data is available.
 - If the selected timeline range contains more than 100 events, a message (5) indicates the user to reduce the boundaries of the timeline in order to display the event data.

### Electrode Map 
The current implementation of the Electrode Map supports 2 display modes: 2D and 3D.

| 2D View | 3D View |
|:-------------------------:|:-------------------------:|
|<img width="300" src="./../../images/electrodes-2d-hover.png"/><br/> The 2D view is a stereographic projection of the electrodes position. Electrodes are indexed and their name is displayed on mouse hover.  | <img width="300" src="./../../images/electrodes-3d.png" /><br/> The 3D view displays the exact position of the electrodes on the brain. |

### Future developements to come

A signal annotation feature is currently under development.
