# View Session

This page displays all available information collected for an individual recording session.

Summary information about the candidate, the scan session and the hardware used is displayed.

Scan files (EEG, Electrode info, Channels info and Events) can be downloaded individually or as a compressed folder (*All Files* download).
On the left, *Next* and *Previous* buttons can be used to navigate between sessions by their number (the leftmost column in the front page of the module). Navigate back to the main page of the module by clicking on its name in the breadcrumb trail placed the top of the page.
