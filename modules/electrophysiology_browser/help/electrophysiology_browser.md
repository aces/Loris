This module allows you to review and download EEG recordings and metadata.  Downloads are organized according the EEG-BIDS standard. 

The selection filter allows you to narrow down candidate sessions. Clicking on one of the columns in the data table allows you to sort alphabetically or numerically by that column. Individual sessions can be accessed by clicking on the *raw* (for raw datasets) or *all types* (for all data) links of one of the rows under the links column, which will redirect you to the *View Session* page.
