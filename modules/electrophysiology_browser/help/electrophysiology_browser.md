This module allows you to review, filter and download EEG recordings and metadata.  Downloads are organized according to the EEG-BIDS standard. 

Individual sessions can be accessed by clicking on the *raw* (for raw datasets) or *all types* (for all data) links of one of the rows under the links column, which will redirect you to the *View Session* page.
