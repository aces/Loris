# Data Team Helper

## Purpose

The Data Team Helper module is intended to provide a dashboard to
make it easier for the data entry staff of a LORIS project to access
all the unfinished data entry.

## Scope

The data team helper provides links to unfinished data in other
LORIS modules in a centralized place. In particular, it links to
open feedback, unresolved conflict, and candidate instruments where
the data entry (or double data entry) has not yet been completed.

## Permissions

Accessing the module requires the `data_team_helper` permission.

## Configurations

There are no configurations for this module.

## Interactions with LORIS

The Data Team Helper module links to the feedback module, the
conflict resolver, and the data entry for particular instruments.
