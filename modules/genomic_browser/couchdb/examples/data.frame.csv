### This file is a example of data.frame file expected by the CouchDB importer of LORIS. 
###
### Comment line start with (###).
### Those lines will be ignored.
###
### Any informations about history or provenance should be on a line stating with (##). 
### Those informations should be represented as key, value pairs and will be kept as string.
### The key needs to be a single word at the start of the line.
### The actual separator is single comma.
### Invalid lines will be ommited.
### The following information are required :
### --REQUIRED--> variable_type: This is used to create the tabs in the genomic browser. 
### --REQUIRED--> variable_format: One of float, integer, string. variable values will always be stored as string be this specify of to display them.
### --REQUIRED--> sample_count: How many column to treaty as samples starting from the right of the data.frame
###
### The headers line should start with a single (#).
### There should be only one headers line.
### Headers will be put to lower case, whites-space trimmed at both ends then spaces and dash will be replaced by underscore. ( UCSC Gene-group =>ucsc_gene_group)
### Sample headers will not be modified.
### The lines following the headers will be considered as data line.
###
### Data lines should contain at least 4 columns before the samples columns in the following order :
### --REQUIRED--> variable_name, the unique identifier of the variable.
### --REQUIRED--> chromosome, The chromosome where this variable is located.
### --REQUIRED--> start_loc, The loci of that variable.
### --REQUIRED--> size, The number of base paires covered by that variable.
###
### The parser script will stop at the first invaliud line.
