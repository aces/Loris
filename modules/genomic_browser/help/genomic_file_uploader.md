# Genomic Uploader

This tab allows you to upload files to the database. 

Click **Upload File** to reveal an upload pop-up. If you select **Methylation beta-value** from the drop-down, it will trigger the insertion of the beta-value in the database. This requires the PSCID of each candidate to be put in the column headers. It also requires the annotations to exist for each probe.
