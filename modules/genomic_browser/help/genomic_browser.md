This module allows you to view analyzed genetic results cross-linked with behavioural and imaging candidate data. 

Notice there are several tabs to explore—each has a similar set up, with *Selection Filter* sections and a data table below. Use any combination of filters to specify your dataset of interest, which can be downloaded by clicking "Download as CSV". 

The **Profiles** tab displays all genetic data and files stored in LORIS per candidate.

The **GWAS**, **SNP**, **CNV**, and **Methylation** tabs displays analysis-specific datasets performed on a candidate population.

The **Files** tab displays all genetic filesets available for download, and provides upload functionality for Methylation data. Click on any fileset name in the table to load a sub-page displaying its metadata where you can download the file. 


You can upload a file directly in this tab — click on **Upload File** to do so.
