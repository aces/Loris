# Genomic Browser

This module allows you to visualize the results of already analyzed genetic tests cross-linked with behavioral and imaging candidate data.

It is designed for researchers and study personnel who are browsing and reviewing summary data. This module presents summary genomic data of several types, enabling you to review and explore data available for study participants in a cross-modal context. Supported data types include SNP, CNV, and methylation (epigenomic) data.

### Usage
You can switch between the different tabs to view different types of genomic data. The tabs are:
- Profile, GWAS, SNP, CNV, Methylation and Files
- **Profiles**: This tab allows you to get a brief summary of the data available for each participant, including whether SNPs, CNVs and CPGs were found or not.
- **GWAS**: This tab allows you to visualize the results of a genome-wide association study (GWAS) for each participant.
- **SNP**: This tab allows you to visualize the results of a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) analysis for each participant.
- **CNV**: This tab allows you to visualize the results of a copy number variation (CNV) analysis for each participant.
- **Methylation**: This tab allows you to visualize the results of a methylation analysis for each participant.
- **Files**: This tab allows you to upload and download files related to the genomic data.

### Uploading Data
To upload data, you can use the "Upload" button in the "Files" tab. This will allow you to select a file from your computer and upload it to the server. The file should be in a format that is compatible with the module, such as CSV.
