This module allows you to view analyzed genetic results cross-linked with behavioural and imaging candidate data. 

Notice there are several tabs to explore—each has a similar set up, with *Selection Filter* sections and a resulting data table. Use any combination of filters to achieve the desired data output. 

The **Profiles** tab displays all genetic data and files stored in LORIS per candidate.

The **GWAS**, **SNP**, **CNV**, and **Methylation** tabs displays analysis-specific datasets performed on a candidate population.

The **Files** tab displays all genetic filesets available for download, and provides upload functionality for Methylation data. Click on any fileset name in the results data table to view the metadata available for this file. You can upload a file directly in this tab—click on **Upload File** to do so.
