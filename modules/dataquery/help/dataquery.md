# Data Query

This module allows you to query data within LORIS.
There are three steps to defining a query:

- First, you must select the fields that you're
  interested in on the **Define Fields** page.
- Next, you can optionally define filters on the
  **Define Filters** page to restrict the population
  that is returned.
- Finally, you view your query results on the **View Data** page

The **Next Steps** on the bottom right of your screen always the
context-sensitive next steps that you can do to build your query.

Your recently run queries will be displayed in the **Recent Queries** panel
on the first screen of the module (you can return to it at any time by using
the LORIS breadcrumbs.) Instead of building a new query, you can reload a
query that you've recently run by clicking on the load icon next to the query.

Queries can be shared with others by clicking the share icon.
This will cause the query to be shared with all users who
have access to the fields used by the query. It will display
in a **Shared Queries** panel below the **Recent Queries**.

You may also give a query a name at any time by clicking the
pencil icon. This makes it easier to find queries you care
about by giving them an easier to remember name that can be used
for filtering. When you share a query, the name will be shared
along with it.
