## Media Module

### ðŸ“„ Overview

Media module allows users to **upload**, **search** and **edit** media files associated with a specific candidate timepoint in Loris.
Any kind of data associated with a candidate timepoint can be uploaded through this module: PDFs, videos, recordings, scripts, log files, etc. Files can optionally be associated to a specific instrument form within a given candidate timepoint.


>Note: Currently editing functionality only allows editing of certain metadata fields, such as `Comments` and `Date of Administration`.

### ðŸ”’ Permissions

In order to use the media module the user needs one or both of the following permissions:

1. **media_read** - gives user a read-only access to media module (file browsing only)
2. **media_write** - gives user a write access to media module (upload/delete files and edit metadata)

>**Note**: superusers have both of the aforementioned permissions by default! ðŸ’ª

### :file_folder: Upload path

By default, all files are uploaded under `/data/uploads/`.
*(Note this directory is not created by the Loris install script and should be manually created by the admin.)*

The upload path is configurable in `Paths` section of `Configuration` module.

>**Important** 
 >
>The destination directory must have `755` permissions and `$GROUP$` group in order for upload to work. Note: group name is OS dependent. 
>```
>Ubuntu: $GROUP$ = www-data
>CentOS: $GROUP$ = apache
>```


>Make sure to to run these commands where `/data/uploads/` is your upload directory:
>```
>chmod 755 /data/uploads/
>sudo chown lorisadmin:$GROUP$ /data/uploads/
>```

### ðŸ’¯ Features

1. **Browse** a list of uploaded files and related information
2. **Edit** metadata about media files (except timepoint related data such as PSCID, Visit Label and Instrument)
3. **Upload** new files associated to a specific timepoint
  - PSCID, Visit Label and Site are required fields for all uploaded files
  - File name should always start with [PSCID]\_[Visit Label]\_[Instrument] corresponding to the selection in the upload form
4. **Delete** files. Deleting a file hides it from the frontend, but preserves a copy in the database
