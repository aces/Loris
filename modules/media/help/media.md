# Media

This module serves as a repository for files associated with a particular candidate-timepoint or instrument in a study. You can access and upload files such as PDF scans, recordings, log files, or stimulus presentation media in a variety of formats formats, including .pdf, .mp4, .mp3, .txt, and more.

## Search For/Edit a File

In the **Browse** tab, in the *Selection Filter* section, use any combination of filters to narrow down your search for a file or files. The table below will dynamically update with relevant results.  

Depending on the size of your results table, you may have to move the table over using the navigation arrows on either side. If you haven’t seen it already, scrolling to the right will reveal the *Edit Metadata* column. Click **Edit** to edit certain properties of any given file. This will reveal an *Edit Media File* pop-up that allows you to make your desired changes. To finalize your update, click **Update File**. 

Note: only certain metadata/information about the file can be modified once it’s uploaded, not the file itself or its contents. If you need to make changes to the file or its contents, such as PSCID, visit label, site, or instrument, you would have to delete that file and re-upload it with the correct information. 

## Upload a File

In the **Upload** tab, populate the fields with information about the file. Click **Browse** to select the desired file from your computer. Click **Upload File** to complete the upload. 

Note: uploaded files must follow the naming convention listed at the top of the Upload page.
