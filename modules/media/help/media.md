# Media

The Media module serves as a repository for files associated with a particular 
candidate-timepoint or instrument in a study.  Users can access and upload files 
such as PDF scans, recordings, log files, or stimulus presentation media in multiple 
formats such as .pdf, .mp4, .mp3, .txt, etc. 

## Searching for a Media File

Under the Browse tab, use the Selection Filters to search for files by fields such 
as filename, file type, candidate PSCID, Visit Label, Instrument, Site, or 
name of user who uploaded the file.  Partial string matching can be used on many 
fields (e.g. filename).  As filters are selected, the data table below will
dynamically update with relevant results.  Click the “Clear Filters” button to reset 
all filters. 

Within the data table, results can be sorted in ascending or descending order by 
clicking on any column header. To download a file, click on the filename (in blue 
text). 

## Uploading a Media File

Under the “Upload” tab, users will be able to upload a new media file. 
Users must specify information about the file by selecting from a number of dropdown 
menus including PSCID, Visit Label, Site, Instrument (optional), Date of 
Administration, and enter comments on the file in the textbox provided. Lastly, 
users will select the file they wish to upload by clicking the “Browse” button and 
selecting the file from their computer. To begin the upload, users must click 
“Upload File”. 

Note that a file to be uploaded should follow the naming convention listed at the 
top of the Upload page: [PSCID]\_[VisitLabel]\_[Instrument]

## Editing a Media File

Click “Edit” from the “Edit Metadata” column to update or edit certain file 
properties, via the “Edit Media File” page. 

This page allows users to modify information about an uploaded file.  Fields such 
as Date of Administration, Comments, and file visibility (hidden or visible) can be 
updated.  Note that fields such as PSCID, Visit Label, Site, and Instrument cannot 
be modified on uploaded media files. To finalize an update, users must click “Update 
File”.
