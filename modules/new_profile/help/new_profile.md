# New Profile

By clicking on "New Profile" under the Candidate Menu, users with appropriate permissions can register a new candidate for their study site. Once inside the "New Profile" page, the "Date of Birth" field must be entered twice, in order to minimize error in data entry. 
The PSCID refers to an alphanumeric identifier entered by the user. This identifier is typically comprised of a site-specific code (e.g., AAA), followed by a numeric code specific to the candidate at that site (e.g., AAA0000). Other fields are customized for specific projects and can be configured as drop-down fields or user input fields. 
Once all the required data fields are completed, the user can click on the "Create" button to finish registering the candidate. It is crucial that no mistakes in data entry are made at this point, as information cannot be modified after clicking the "Create" button. 

Each new candidate will then be assigned a 6 digit numerical DCCID. The DCCID, along with the previously entered PSCID, will always be used to identify this candidate.
