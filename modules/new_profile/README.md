# New Profile

## Purpose

The new_profile module is intended to allow users to create new
candidates in a LORIS database.

## Intended Users

It is primarily used by data entry staff to create candidates for
data entry.

It may also be used by users uploading imaging data to ensure that
a candidate exists before uploading the image.

## Scope

The new_profile module only creates candidates.

NOT in scope:

The new_profile module does not create timepoints, batteries, or
anything else related to candidates, only the candidate itself.

## Configurations

- `useEDC`: This config setting determines whether to prompt for
  the EDC of the candidate being created.
- `StartYear`, `EndYear`, `AgeMin`, `AgeMax`: These are used to
  determine whether the candidate's date of birth is within the
  range of the study protocol.
- `PSCID`: This is used to determine whether the PSCID for the new
  candidate is autogenerated, prompted for, and what the format of
  the PSCID that is valid for the study is.

## Permissions

The module requires the data_entry permission and at least one site
for the user creating a candidate.

## Interactions With LORIS

Upon candidate creation, the module includes a link to the
timepoint_list module for the newly created candidate.
