New Profile Test Plan:

1. Access New Profile page and ensure that it renders.
2. Access with useProjects on/off and ensure that the field appears/disappears
3. Access with useEDC on/off and ensure that the field appears/disappears
4. Ensure that you get an error if dates don't match (both DoB and EDC)
5. Ensure that you get an error if any field is missing.
6. Ensure that all valid fields added creates a new candidate with autogenerated PSCID (if PSCID generation is "sequential").
7. Change PSCID generation configuration to "user". Ensure that you get an error if an invalid PSCID entered (and not if a valid PSCID is entered)
8. Change date format from 'YMd' to 'YM' in the Configuration module and repeat steps 4 to 6 while asserting that database values being saved are correct.
