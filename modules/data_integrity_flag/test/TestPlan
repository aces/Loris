Data Integrity Flag Test Plan

1. User has access to Data Integrity Flag if he/she has permission “data_integrity_flag”.
2. Check that tab exists on a default install
3. Check that results are being shown/populated in the bottom table
4. Check that the filters work, it’s not letting me choose other instruments under certain conditions, also <All Instruments> in the Selection Filter is shown twice
5. GUI(especially tables,buttons) needs to be updated
6. Check that the data_entry completion percentage is being calculated correctly
7. Check that the form saves
8. Misc:
      Syntax could use some clean up: 
      <NOTE: Please click on 'show-data' or refresh the page, once the 'save' button is clicked">
      <Current Data_entry Completion Percentage (for V01 and instrument: aosi)>
