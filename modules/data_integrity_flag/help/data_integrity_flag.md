This module provides a direct way to view and update behavioural feedback at-a-glance.

In the **Browse** tab, use the *Selection Filter* section to search for existing feedback. You can click any link in the *Instrument* column to view a detailed summary of each field for that instrument and visit.

In the **Update** tab, you can add a new instrument status. Populate the fields and click **Update**. Newly updated feedback should appear in the data table within the **Browse** tab.
