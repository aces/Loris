# Data Integrity Flag

This module provides a direct way to view and update behavioural feedback at-a-glance.

In the **Browse** tab, use the *Selection Filter* section to search for existing feedback. You can click any link in the *Instrument* column to view a detailed summary of each field for that instrument and visit.

In the **Update** tab, you can add a new instrument Flag status. 
You'll notice that  Flag Status is coded as:

- 1 = Ready for Review<br>
- 2 = Review Completed<br>
- 3 = All Feedback Closed<br>
- 4 = Finalization

Populate the fields and click **Update**. 

Newly updated feedback should appear in the data table within the **Browse** tab.
