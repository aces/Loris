# Imaging Browser: View Session

This page displays a candidate's scans collected from a single timepoint. Click on any image to launch the BrainBrowser visualization tool. With every file displayed, there are different actions you can take, such as change the file's QC status, add or edit the QC comments, download the MINC file, or see a longitudinal view (in BrainBrowser). Click **Header Info** to see further scan parameters from the DICOM header.

To the right of image thumbnails, there is a list of scan parameters including QC Status, "Selected" (indicating which scan will be available in the data query tool when there are multiple scans of a single modality), and a Caveat flag (True/False). Within the same
panel, you click **Header Info** located in the top right corner to expand the panel, revealing further scan parameters from the
DICOM header.

Each scan has a checkbox in the top left corner of its panel, to the left of its file name. You can use these to overlay two scans in BrainBrowser. For example, you can check the boxes for a T1 and a T2, and then click 3D + Overlay, which will align the volumes for your comparison. 

In the left sidebar, you can download all DICOMs or view DICOM archive details, and jump to the MRI Parameter form where detailed notes from the scan session are recorded. Under the *Visit level QC* section, you can set or edit details regarding the QC status of this entire visit. Click **Save** to save any changes you make in this section. Click **Visit Level Feedback** to enter comments on the visit.
