This page displays a candidate's scans collected from a single time-point. Click on any image to launch the BrainBrowser visualization tool. With every file displayed, there are different actions you can take. Use the dropdown menus to change the fileâ€™s QC Status, Selected, and Caveat. You can also edit the QC comments, download the MINC file, or see a longitudinal view (in BrainBrowser). Click **Header Info** to see further scan parameters from the DICOM header.

Notice that each scan has a checkbox in the top left corner of its panel. You can check these boxes, then click **3D Only** or **3D + Overlay** which will overlay the selected volumes.

In the *Links* section of the left sidebar, you can click on any of the links to access other LORIS imaging modules and features. 

Also in the left sidebar, under the *Visit Level QC* section, you can set/edit details regarding the QC status of this dataset. Since this is at the visit level, any changes you make here will refer to every scan in that set. Make sure you click **Save** to save any changes you make in this section. Click **Visit Level Feedback** to enter comments on the entire time-point.
