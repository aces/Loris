# Imaging Browser: View Session

This page displays a candidate's scans collected from a single timepoint. Click on any image to launch the BrainBrowser visualization tool. With every file displayed, there are different actions you can take, such as change the file's QC status, add or edit the QC comments, download the MINC file, or see a longitudinal view (in BrainBrowser). Click **Header Info** to see further scan parameters from the DICOM header.

Each scan has a checkbox in the top left corner of its panel, to the left of its file name. You can check any number of these boxes, then click **3D + Overlay** which will overlay the selected volumes for your comparison. 

In the *Links* section of the left sidebar, you can click on any of the links to access other LORIS imaging modules and features. 

Also in the left sidebar, under the *Visit Level QC* section, you can set or edit details regarding the QC status of this entire visit. Click **Visit Level Feedback** to enter comments on the visit. Click **Save** to save any changes you make in this section.
