This module allows you to view candidate scan sessions collected at time-points (visits) across the study.

Use the *Selection Filter* section to narrow your search. The resulting table below will automatically update with matching results as you type. 

Sort the data table results by clicking on any column header. The date of first acquisition of all scans for the timepoint is indicated under the *First Acquisition* column.  The *Last QC* column shows the date of the most recent Quality Control (QC) on any scan in the
session. New scans awaiting QC will be marked NEW (in red) in the *New Data* column.

You can download, visualize, add QC annotation, or view details of imaging files for a specific candidate from any visit shown. To do so, click on one of the options in *Links* column. **Native** will show only raw imaging datasets. **Selected** will show only scans that will be displayed in the data query tool. **All types** displays all data, including analyzed outputs. Once you click on a link, youâ€™ll arrive at a *View Session* page for that specific dataset.
