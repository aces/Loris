# Imaging Browser

The Imaging Browser allows users to browse and view candidate scan
sessions collected at time-points (visits) across the study.

## Searching for a candidate's scans

Use the Selection Filter panel to specify search criteria such as
candidate PSCID, DCCID, Visit Label, Site, Quality Control (QC)
status of the scanning session, and any sequence type (T1, T2, DTI)
in the scan session.  As well, users may filter for scans that are
New (have not had any QC done), Pending (QC is not finalized) or both.

After specifying search criteria in the selection filters, click
"Show Data" to display results in the data table below, with one
row per relevant scanning session. Click "Clear Form" to reset all
selection filters.

Sort the data table results by clicking on any column header.  The
date of first acquisition of all scans for the timepoint is indicated
under the "First Acquisition " column.  The "Last QC" column shows the
date of the most recent Quality Control (QC) on any scan in the
session. New scans awaiting Quality Control (QC) will be marked
"NEW" (in red) under the "New Data" column.

To download, visualize, add QC annotation or view details of imaging
files for a candidate-timepoint, select a dataset type under the "Links"
columns: "native", "selected" (one selected scan per modality will
be displayed in the data query tool) or "all types".

"Native" will show only raw imaging datasets, "Selected" displays
only scans which will be displayed in the data query tool, and "all
types" displays all data, including analyzed outputs. By clicking
on any of these links, the user will be able to see details for
that specific candidate's dataset from a given scan session.
