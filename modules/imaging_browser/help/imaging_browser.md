This module allows you to view candidate scan sessions collected at time-points (visits) across the study.

Use the *Selection Filter* section to narrow your search. The resulting table below will automatically update with matching results as you type. 

You can download, visualize, add QC annotation, or view details of imaging files for a specific candidate from one visit. To do so, click on one of the options in *Links* column. **Native** will show only raw imaging datasets. **Selected** will show only scans that will be displayed in the data query tool. **All types** displays all data, including analyzed outputs. Once you click on a link, youâ€™ll arrive at a *View Session* page for that specific dataset.
