# Examiner

The Examiner tab allows the authorized user to add, view, or modify examiners and their certifications.

To add an examiner, the name and site of the examiner must be specified, as well as whether or not the examiner is a radiologist. 

The Examiner Module has a Selection Filter function to allow users to search for a particular examiner and/or site. By clicking the button Show Data after selecting certain search options, the search results will appear, organized by the blue headers Examiner, Site, Radiologist, and Certification. 

By clicking on an examiner's name, the certification for that examiner can be added or modified. To edit certification for an examiner, choose an instrument under the  Instrument header, click the Certification Status drop-down, select the correct Certification Date and enter in any pertinent comments. Any modifications to an examiner\'s certification will appear in the Change Log.
