# Examiner

This module allows you to add, view, or modify examiners and their certifications. An examiner is the person certified to administer a specific instrument, or in some cases the person entering data into the database. 

To add a new examiner, enter their name, select their site, and specify whether they are a radiologist. Then, click **Add Examiner**. 

To search for an existing examiner, use the *Selection Filter* section to narrow the results displayed in the table below.

Click on any examinerâ€™s name to add, view, or modify their certification status. Any changes will be tracked in the Change Log below.
