      - There can be only one Highlander.
      - User management / Survey module.
2. If you have access to the User Module, you should see all the users if you have permission 'Across all sites edit 
   create users'. Otherwise, only the users that belong to your site are shown.
3. Check that the Clear Form button works.
4. Search according to all criteria: site, user name, active, full name, pending approval, email and examiner. 
5. Check that if Site is set to 'All' in the filter, users that have a different site than the user logged in are 
   returned by the search (if any).
