                             User Account module - Test plan
                             ===============================

1. Make sure you do not have access to the User Account page if you do not have at least one of these permissions:
      - There can be only one Highlander.
      - User management / Survey module.
2. If you have access to the User Module, you should see all the users if you have permission 'Across all sites edit 
   create users'. Otherwise, only the users that belong to your site are shown.
3. Check that the Clear Form button works.
4. Search according to all criteria: site, user name, active, full name, pending approval, email and examiner. 
5. Check that if Site is set to 'All' in the filter, users that have a different site than the user logged in are 
   returned by the search (if any).
6. Try to add a user with a user name already taken: check that you can't.

When creating or editing a user: (subtest: edit_user)
========================================================

7. Check that password rules are enforced.
8. Check that saving fails if you do not enter at least these informations:
      - User name.
      - Password (and confirm password).
      - First name.
      - Last name.
      - Email.
9. Check that if password and confirmed password do not match you get an error.
10. Check that if you do not enter an email address that is syntactically valid you get an error.
10a. Check that when creating a new user, there is an additional "Confirm email" text field on the page and that you 
     get an error message if email and confirmed email don't match when submitting the form. 
10b. Make sure that the confirm email text field is not on the edit user page (only on the create new user page).
11. For an existing active user, edit the user's account and click 'Generate new password' and check 'Send email'.
    Save. Check that an email is sent to the user with the new password. Check that the password rules are enforced 
    for this new password. Check that after logging in, the user is immediately asked to update his/her password.
12. Check that if creating a new user an email is sent to him/her (requires email server). Also check that when a new
    user is logging in for the first time he/she is asked to change his/her password.
12a. Check that when creating a new user, leading and trailing spaces in the username are stripped.
12b. Check that you can create a new user with name 00 (double zero).
12c. Check that you can delete one of the additional fields (organization, fax, etc...) that was previously set and that the save is performed.
13. Check that if modifying a password for a user an email is sent to that user containing the new password (requires
    email server).
14. Check that when editing a user account it is not possible to set the password to its actual value (i.e. it needs to change).
15. Check that if the 'Display additional information' entry is set to false in the Configuration module, fields Degree,
    Academic Position, Institution, Department, Street Address, City, State/Province, Zip/Postal Code, Country and 
    FAX are not shown.
16. Check that selecting sites for the "Examiner At:" Section and saving, adds user X to the Examiner list (and in examiners table).
17. Check that de-selecting sites from the "Examiner At:" section and saving, does NOT delete X from the Examiner table but rather sets them as inactive for that site.
18. Check that setting the radiologist to Yes/No changes the values for X for all sites
19. Check that by removing the "examiner_multisite" permission, the user(editor) can not modify X's Examiner Status.
20. Setting the Pending Approval for user X prevents user X from logging in until his/her account is approved.
21. Setting the Active=”No” for user X prevents user X from logging in until his/her account is active again.
22. Check that modifications made to the basic user infos are displayed when the user table is reloaded.
23. When editing an existing user: Check that Reset button restores previous settings (does not wipe all settings, or
    retain any changes).
24. When editing an existing user: Check that Back button takes you to the User Account page and does not save any
    changes. 
25. When editing an existing user: Clicking on the 'User Account' breadcrumb takes you to the User Account page
    without saving any changes to the user profile.

On the My Preferences page:
==========================

26. Check that all users (even those with NO permissions) have access to the My Preferences page.
27. Change the user’s password.  Check that the password rules are enforced.
28. Check that if password and confirmed password do not match you get an error.
29. Check that saving fails if any field is left blank (except password).
30. Check that if you do not enter an email address that is syntactically valid you get an error.
31. Modify any field on the page and save, and go to the User Account page. Check that the modifications are
    displayed when looking at the modified user account.  
32. Verify that all notification checkboxes match what the project has enabled in the `notification_modules_services_rel`. See WIKI for more details https://github.com/aces/Loris/wiki/Notification-system.
33. Verify that checkboxes available respect the permission restrictions set in the `notification_modules_perm_rel`. See WIKI for more details https://github.com/aces/Loris/wiki/Notification-system.
34. Verify that the notifications are sent when the trigger event occurs. (NB the user triggering the event will not get the email, only other registered users are notified)
35. Clicking on the 'User Account' breadcrumb takes you to the User Account page without saving any changes. If you do not have access to the user account module, the system should tell you so.
