**User Accounts** 

This feature of LORIS allows an administrator to create accounts and set the Roles and Permissions for database users. Like many modules in LORIS, User Accounts has a Selection Filter which allows the user to quickly search for desired information. The Selection Filter panel can be hidden using the upward arrow icon , and reopened using the downward arrow icon. Once the appropriate user has been found, the profile can be viewed by selecting the "Username" outlined in navy text.

**Add or Edit User Accounts** 

On this page, the user may enter and modify detailed information including address, degree, position and password. By checking a series of boxes under "Roles" and "Permissions" an administrator-level user may add, change or remove a userâ€™s access to areas or functions in the database. After making changes, the administrator must click "Save" to ensure the permissions are updated. Note that permissions may be "Reset" by selecting the appropriate button. The administrator may also return to the list of users by selecting "Back".

**My Preferences** 

This module allows the user to modify first name, last name, email address, and current password, as well as Document Repository preferences. All changes made to the userâ€™s preferences must be saved by clicking "Save" after completion. Information can be reset using the "Reset"
