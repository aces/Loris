# User Accounts

This module allows you—if you’re an administrator—to create accounts and set Roles and Permissions for database users. Use the *Selection Filter* section, to narrow your search, and view results in the data table below. Click on any Username in the table to view or edit user account information, reset password, and alter the user’s database privileges. 

Click **Add User** to add a new user. Then, populate the fields and click **Save**. Pay attention to the Password Rules and Notes provided at the top of the page.
