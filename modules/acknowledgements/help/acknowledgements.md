# Acknowledgements

The Acknowledgements module is designed to serve as a study resource for acknowledging contributors when writing publications. The module stores individual contributor details such as affiliation(s), degree(s), and role(s) within the project, as well as how to cite the contributorâ€™s name for publication.

Users may search for a specific contributor or group of contributors using Selection Filters for Start and/or End date of their contribution to the study, and whether they are still currently involved in the project, as well as Full Name and Citation Name.
