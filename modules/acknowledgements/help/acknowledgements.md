# Acknowledgements

This module allows you to view present and past contributors, and to add contributors. This provides a centralized resource when writing publications, including how to cite the individualâ€™s name for publication, as well as the years of their contribution.

The "Present" column in the table allows you to filter for whether a contributor to the project is currently active or past their end date.

Use the *Selection Filter* section to search for a specific contributor or group of contributors. Click **Add Acknowledgement** to add a new contributor or contributors. Then, populate the fields and click **Save**.
