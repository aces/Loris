# Imaging Quality Control

This module allows you to view specific data on uploaded imaging files. Its purpose is to verify that imaging data has been uploaded properly, and to see their Quality Control (QC) status.

Use the *Selection Filter* section to narrow your search for specific data.

The resulting data table lists details on every scan that results from your search. Notice that this table shows you helpful details of the scan, including the scan’s location, whether there is an associated MRI Parameter Form, and whether the scan has passed QC. If the scan has been complete in the MRI form, then you’ll be able to click **Yes** in the *Scan Done in MRI PF* column. This will bring you to the form for that scan.
