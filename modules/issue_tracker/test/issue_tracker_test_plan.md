1. User can access the page only if they have `issue_tracker_reporter` or `issue_tracker_developer` permission
2. User can see data from other sites only if they have `access_all_profiles` permission
3. Test that all filters work. Nothing should be filtered at first loading.
4. Test that all tabs (with filters) work and redirect to the correct table.
