# Issue Tracker: Add or Edit Issue

On this page, you can submit and edit issues. Populate or modify the fields in this page and click **Submit Issue**. Note that you cannot submit PSCIDs from sites you don't have access to.

## Watching list
You can also add users to the *Watching* list - this will send email notifications to the selected users when the issue is created and updated. 

If you are the author of an issue, and you add yourself as Watching, you won't be sent notifications about your own updates.
