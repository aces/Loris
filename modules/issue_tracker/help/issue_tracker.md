# Issue Tracker

This module allows you to submit, edit, view, and track issues.

Use the *Selection Filter* section to search for specific issues, if desired. In the data table, you can navigate between different tabs—**All Issues**, **Active Issues**, **Closed Issues**, and **My Issues**—to further narrow your results. 

In the table, in the *Title* column, you can click on any issue name to edit its details. 

Click **New Issue** if you wish to add a new issue. Then, populate the fields and click **Submit Issue**.

Note that you can add "Watchers" to an issue - this will send email notifications to the given user when the issue is created and updated.  If you are the author of an issue, and you add yourself as a Watcher, you won't receive notifications about your own updates.
