# Issue Tracker Help

The Issue Tracker module allows users to submit, edit, view and track issues 

## View Issues

Click on a tab for easy access to pre-filtered issue lists. Use the drop-down fields to further sort the data. The date field allows you to specify the earliest submitted issue you would like to see as well as issues submitted not past a certain date. 

## Edit Issue

Click on the blue issue title within the table to view and edit further details for that issue. If you do not have edit permissions you will be blocked from doing so but will still be able to view the data. 

## Add issue

To add an issue, click “add issue”. After valid data is entered (users must supply a title, a priority and cannot enter incorrect PSCIDs or visit labels), you will be redirected back to the default table view. 

## Permissions

Permissions are in accordance with the data permissions granted to that user - if a user can not see data outside of their site, they will only be able to view issues relevant to their site. If a user has DCC permission they will be able to see issues relevant to all sites. Additionally, users can be designated reporters or developers. Reporters can add issues, edit their own issues, and comment on all issues. Developers can additionally edit all issues, and mark them as resolved. Most users of Loris will be designated as reporters.
