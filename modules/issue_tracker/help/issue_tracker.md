# Issue Tracker

This module allows you to submit, edit, view, upload and track issues.

Use the *Selection Filter* section to search for specific issues, if desired. In the data table, you can navigate between different tabs—**All Issues**, **Active Issues**, **Closed Issues**, and **My Issues**—to further narrow your results. 

In the table, in the *Title* column, you can click on any issue name to edit its details. 

Click **New Issue** if you wish to add a new issue. Then, populate the fields and click **Submit Issue**. You may also upload an attachment for the issue.

Note that you can add users to the "Watching" list - this will send email notifications to the selected users when the issue is created and updated. If you are the author of an issue, and you add yourself as Watching, you won't be sent notifications about your own updates.
