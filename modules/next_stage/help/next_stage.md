# Next Stage

This module prompts for the date of the current visit to start the Visit Stage of the session and populate the instrument list page with the relevant instruments. 

Once the date of the visit is entered and the user clicks on "Start Visit", the user will be redirected to a page with a success message and a link to the updated instrument list page.
