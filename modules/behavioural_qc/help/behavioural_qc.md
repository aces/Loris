# Behavioural Quality Control (QC)

This module allows you to view incomplete forms, data entry conflicts, and outstanding behavioural feedback for a given candidate and/or instrument.

Use the *Selection Filter* section to define your search. Results will appear in the data table below. The data completion meter to the right will also update to reflect your filters.

In the results table, you can view data within three tabs: Incomplete Forms, Data Conflicts, and Behavioural Feedback.

## Incomplete Forms

In this tab, you'll see a list of forms that have not yet been marked as "Data Entry = Complete", "Administration = All" associated with their search criteria. Click on an instrument in the *Instrument* column to access the incomplete form. You can complete the form from there.

## Data Conflicts

In this tab, you'll see any forms flagged for data conflicts if your study uses double data entry. Click on an instrument in the *Instrument* column to access the data conflict in the **Conflict Resolver** module. You can fix the conflict from there. 

## Behavioural Feedback

In this tab, you'll see a list of candidates with outstanding behavioural feedback. Click on an instrument name in the *Feedback Level* column to access the appropriate page for which the feedback corresponds to. You can manage the feedback from there.
