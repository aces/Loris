# Behavioural Quality Control (QC)

This module allows you to view outstanding behavioural feedback, data entry conflicts, and incomplete forms for a given candidate and/or instrument.

Use the *Selection Filter* section to define your search. Results will appear in the data table below. The data completion meter to the right will also update to reflect your filters.

In the results table, you can view data within three tabs: Incomplete Forms, Data Conflicts, and Behavioural Feedback. Most of the information displayed in these tables are clickable (presented as blue links). Click on any of these links to redirect to more relevant detailed information.
