# Data Release

The Data Release Module can be used to easily distribute packaged data releases of your study. Use the "Upload File" button to upload your file and tag it with a version based on your own versioning convention. Grant access to any of your users using the "Add Permission" button. These buttons will be visible only if you have the proper permissions.
