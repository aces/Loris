# LORIS

Welcome to the LORIS database.

Access the different modules within LORIS using the top menu bar.

Every module has a summary page, similar to this one, accessed by the question mark icon in the top right corner. This is designed to give you an overview of the module, what you can do with it, and how.

## Dashboard Features

This is where you’ll find an at-a-glance status of your LORIS study. Note that the charts in these sections include data from ineligible, excluded, and consent-withdrawn candidates. You can temporarily hide any of the sections from view by clicking the arrow located in the top right corner. We’ve broken down the different sections below:

#### Recruitment

Number of candidates that have been recruited for a given study. Click **Views** to narrow this view by site or project.

#### Study Progression

A timeline of scans collected by each study site, or a timeline of candidate recruitment per site. Zoom in on the chart to view detailed data points.

#### My Tasks

User-specific list of outstanding tasks such as data entry conflicts, incomplete forms, or new and pending scans awaiting review. Click on any task panel to jump to the appropriate module.

#### Document Repository Notifications

Recently-uploaded documents for your study. Click on a document name to download the file directly from the Dashboard. Click **Document Repository** to view the complete list of available documents.

#### Behavioral Feedback Notifications

Track issues and corrections to behavioural/clinical data points. Click on a notification to redirect to the instrument with new changes or feedback.
