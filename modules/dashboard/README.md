# Dashboard

## Purpose

 The Dashboard serves as a landing page for all users logging into LORIS.  It provides introductory information and a primary quick-access interface for user workflows, including outstanding tasks and notifications of recent activity/additions in LORIS.  The Dashboard also provides visual summaries of data contained in LORIS at a glance, and charts dynamic data breakdowns that can be used in reporting. 

## Intended Users

 All LORIS users can view the dashboard.  

## Scope

 Any LORIS user can edit and delete all the files in the Document Repository module. 

## Permissions

Components of the Dashboard are governed by permissions related to the module-specific privilege.  For example, Document Repository notifications panel is displayed if a user has the "document_repository_view" or "document_repository_delete" permission. Site access privileges are also enforced. 

## Configurations

Many aspects of the Dashboard are configured in the Configuration module, under the Admin menu.
