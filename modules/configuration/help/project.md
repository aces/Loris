# Configuration: Project

Use this page to manage the configuration of existing projects, or to add a new one. Your projects are listed on the left side of the screen. Click on any project name to edits its settings, and click **Save**. 

Click **New ProjectID** from the left side to crate a new project. Populate the fields and click **Save**. Your new project should now appear in the list, after you refresh the page. 

Note: Clicking save more than once will register a duplicate ProjectID. If you create an extra ID, you have to delete it from the database manually with an sql command.\n\nDefine all projectID-subprojectID relationships by populating the project_rel table.
