# Configuration Module

The Configuration Module allows admin-level users to edit customized configuration settings from the front end of LORIS. (Any settings not currently in the Configuration Module are located in the <i>project/config.xml</i> file.)

The Config Settings are organized into sections such as Study, Paths, WWW, etc.  An admin-level user can edit individual settings within each of these sections.

Some configuration settings can accept multiple values.  For these settings, add/remove additional values using the "Add Field" and “Delete” buttons.

Click “Submit” at the bottom of each section to confirm and save any changes to settings in that section. You will see a brief success message “Submitted”, after changes are saved.\r\n\r\nCare should be taken when editing the fields as there is currently no way to revert changes once saved. To cancel any unsaved changes to configuration settings, click “Reset” to reload the section with the previously-stored values.
