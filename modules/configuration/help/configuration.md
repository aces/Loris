# Configuration

This module allows you to edit configuration settings for your LORIS instance.

Click on any of the configurable options along the left side in order to edit. Populate the fields as necessary and click **Submit**. 

Some configuration settings can accept multiple values. For these settings, you can add additional fields by clicking **Add Field**. This will create a new field where you can insert your values. You can click on the associated red **“X”** to delete any of these additional fields.

**Note:** Take caution while editing these fields. Once you click **Submit**, there is no way to undo changes, unless you re-edit and re-submit a new form.

**Note:** at the top of the page, you can click the links to configure study projects and subprojects.
