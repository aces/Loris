# Configuration

To edit any configuration settings, navigate to the field that you'd
like to edit in the module, and edit or insert a new value.

Some configuration settings can accept multiple values. For these
settings, you can add additional fields by pressing the "Add Field"
button. This will create an empty form area where you can insert
new values. You can delete any of the settings by pressing the red
delete button attached to the form.

Press the submit button at the bottom of the page to save your
changes.  Pressing the submit button on a page will not save changes
made on other pages.

Care should be taken when editing the fields as there is currently
no way to "undo" changes. You can reset the form to its values on
page load by pressing the reset button. However, this will not undo
any changes made before the submit button has been pressed.
