# Configuration: Subproject

Use this page to manage the configuration of existing subprojects, or to add a new one. 

Select your desired subproject from the list on the left side. Update the fields as necessary and click **Save.**

Click **New SubprojectID** to create a new subproject. Populate the fields and click **Save**. 

Note: Clicking save more than once will register a duplicate subproject ID.  If you create an extra ID, you have to delete it from the database manually with an sql command.\n\nDefine all projectID-subprojectID relationships by populating the project_rel table.
