2. Check that tab exists on a default install (for superusers).
3. Check that the warning text above is accurate (about writable/uploading etc).
4. Verify GUI is updated.
5. Check that instrument gets installed properly. Also check the paths in the code.
6. Check that instruments' metadata in the table are labeled accurately.
7. Check that function CheckTable performs the right checks, datatypes
