# Instrument manager

The Instrument Manager module allows LORIS Admin-level superusers to upload and install instrument forms (*.linst files), and to monitor instrument status in LORIS.

To upload an instrument, users must select the file of the instrument they wish to upload from their computer by clicking the “Browse” button. 
Once the user has selected the file, they must press “Install Instrument” to finalize the installment of the instrument in LORIS.
