Instrument Manager Test Plan

1. User has access to Instrument Manager if he/she has permission “superuser”.
2. Check that tab exists on a default install (for superusers).
3. Check that the warning text above is accurate (about writable/uploading etc).
4. Verify GUI is updated.
5. Check that instrument gets installed properly. Also check the paths in the code.
6. Check that instruments' metadata in the table are labeled accurately.
7. Check that function CheckTable does what's it's supposed to do because I don't have time I have to go to a meeting right now.
