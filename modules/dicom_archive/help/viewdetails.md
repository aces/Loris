# DICOM Archive Details

The ViewDetails page shows the details of a particular dicom tar.

It displays the various session summary headers in a table, 
followed by a hash of the file, followed by a table of all series
which are part of the dicom tar.

After the series is an expandable (by default collapsed) list of all
*files* in the dicomTar. You can expand or collapse this list by clicking
Show/Hide files.

Finally, Show/Hide Metadata shows all information stored in the dicom tar's
meta file, which is created by dicomTar.
