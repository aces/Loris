# DICOM Archive: Tarchive Metadata

The “View Details” page of the DICOM Archive displays metadata for a given DICOM tarchive (compressed package of DICOM files). 

All DICOM header fields and other metadata from the DICOM dataset are presented in the page, including information about the candidate, number of acquisitions, where the files were acquired, and all files contained within the given archive.

Clicking on the Acquisition ID number (in blue text) will bring users to the MRI Violated Scans module displaying any issues encountered for this scan regarding protocol checks or data integrity. 
Users can easily view the history of protocol check violations or data loading concerns associated with this scan.
