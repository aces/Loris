# Instruments

Inside the instrument form, general information is shown at the top including date of birth, sex, visit label, and subproject(cohort).
If a form has multiple pages, enter and save data on each subpage, then return to the Top page and click "Save".  Scoring will be calculated only after Save is clicked.  After entering all data, use the status flags and "Send to DCC" in the left sidebar to complete the instrument form. 

The Data Entry flag can only be set to Complete after the Administration and Validity flags have been set.
While the Data Entry status is `In Progress`, you may see in the sidebar the option to delete all the instrument data which will clear all data in the form.
