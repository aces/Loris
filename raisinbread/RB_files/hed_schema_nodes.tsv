1130	1104	2	Syncope	Episode/Syncope	Episode with loss of consciousness and muscle tone that is abrupt in onset, of short duration and followed by rapid recovery; it occurs in response to transient impairment of cerebral perfusion. Typical prodromal symptoms often herald onset of syncope and postictal symptoms are minimal. Syncopal convulsions resulting from cerebral anoxia are common but are not a form of epilepsy, nor are there any accompanying EEG ictal discharges.
1131	1104	2	Cataplexy	Episode/Cataplexy	A sudden decrement in muscle tone and loss of deep tendon reflexes, leading to muscle weakness, paralysis, or postural collapse. Cataplexy usually is precipitated by an outburst of emotional expression-notably laughter, anger, or startle. It is one of the tetrad of symptoms of narcolepsy. During cataplexy, respiration and voluntary eye movements are not compromised. Consciousness is preserved.

Small sharp spikes (SSS) of very short duration and low amplitude, often followed by a small theta wave, occurring in the temporal regions during drowsiness and light sleep. They occur on one or both sides (often asynchronously). The main negative and positive components are of about equally spiky character.

1160	1159	2	Eye-blink-artifact	Artifact/Biological-artifact/Eye-blink-artifact	Example for EEG: Fp1/Fp2 become electropositive with eye closure because the cornea is positively charged causing a negative deflection in Fp1/Fp2. If the eye blink is unilateral, consider prosthetic eye. If it is in F8 rather than Fp2 then the electrodes are plugged in wrong.
1161	1159	2	Eye-movement-horizontal-artifact	Artifact/Biological-artifact/Eye-movement-horizontal-artifact	Example for EEG: There is an upward deflection in the Fp2-F8 derivation, when the eyes move to the right side. In this case F8 becomes more positive and therefore. When the eyes move to the left, F7 becomes more positive and there is an upward deflection in the Fp1-F7 derivation.
1162	1159	2	Eye-movement-vertical-artifact	Artifact/Biological-artifact/Eye-movement-vertical-artifact	Example for EEG: The EEG shows positive potentials (50-100 micro V) with bi-frontal distribution, maximum at Fp1 and Fp2, when the eyeball rotated upward. The downward rotation of the eyeball was associated with the negative deflection. The time course of the deflections was similar to the time course of the eyeball movement.

The artifact produced by the tongue has a broad potential field that drops from frontal to occipital areas, although it is less steep than that produced by eye movement artifacts. The amplitude of the potentials is greater inferiorly than in parasagittal regions; the frequency is variable but usually in the delta range. Chewing and sucking can produce similar artifacts.

If the causing movement is repetitive, the artifact might resemble a rhythmic EEG activity.
1170	1159	2	Respiration-artifact	Artifact/Biological-artifact/Respiration-artifact	Respiration can produce 2 kinds of artifacts. One type is in the form of slow and rhythmic activity, synchronous with the body movements of respiration and mechanically affecting the impedance of (usually) one electrode. The other type can be slow or sharp waves that occur synchronously with inhalation or exhalation and involve those electrodes on which the patient is lying.
1171	1159	2	Pulse-artifact	Artifact/Biological-artifact/Pulse-artifact	Example for EEG: Occurs when an EEG electrode is placed over a pulsating vessel. The pulsation can cause slow waves that may simulate EEG activity. A direct relationship exists between ECG and the pulse waves (200-300 millisecond delay after ECG equals QRS complex).
1172	1159	2	ECG-artifact	Artifact/Biological-artifact/ECG-artifact	Example for EEG: Far-field potential generated in the heart. The voltage and apparent surface of the artifact vary from derivation to derivation and, consequently, from montage to montage. The artifact is observed best in referential montages using earlobe electrodes A1 and A2. ECG artifact is recognized easily by its rhythmicity/regularity and coincidence with the ECG tracing.
1173	1159	2	Sweat-artifact	Artifact/Biological-artifact/Sweat-artifact	Is a low amplitude undulating waveform that is usually greater than 2 seconds and may appear to be an unstable baseline.
1174	1159	2	EMG-artifact	Artifact/Biological-artifact/EMG-artifact	Myogenic potentials are the most common artifacts. Frontalis and temporalis muscles (ex..: clenching of jaw muscles) are common causes. Generally, the potentials generated in the muscles are of shorter duration than those generated in the brain.
