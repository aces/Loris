2	HED_score_1.0.0	1.0.0	This schema is a Hierarchical Event Descriptors (HED) Library Schema implementation of Standardized Computer-based Organized Reporting of EEG (SCORE)[1,2] for describing events occurring during neuroimaging time series recordings.
The HED-SCORE library schema allows neurologists, neurophysiologists, and brain researchers to annotate electrophysiology recordings using terms from an internationally accepted set of defined terms (SCORE) compatible with the HED framework.
The resulting annotations are understandable to clinicians and directly usable in computer analysis.
Future extensions may be implemented in the HED-SCORE library schema.
