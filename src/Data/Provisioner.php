/**
 * A Provisioner is something which retrieves data from a source (usually
 * the SQL database) and applies filters or maps to the data. It represents
 * arbitrarily structured data such as a row in a table. Implementations
 * know the details of the data, but a Provisioner itself only deals with
 * DataInstance objects, Filters and Mappers.
 *
 * Filters generally do things like site based or project based permissions to
 * the data, while mappers do things like anonymization of data.
