# Contributing to Loris

We'd love to have you contribute to Loris. The first thing you should
do before contributing is probably sign up for the [LORIS developers'
mailing list](http://www.bic.mni.mcgill.ca/mailman/listinfo/loris-dev).

Your next step before issuing a pull request is to review our
[Coding Standards](./docs/CodingStandards.md). If you are doing
front-end development you should also check out our [React
guidelines](./LORIS_react.README.md).

You can also learn about our code
review process by perusing our [Code Review
Checklist](https://github.com/aces/Loris/wiki/Code-Review-Checklist)
in the [LORIS Wiki](https://github.com/aces/Loris/wiki). These will be
some of the factors we'll consider when reviewing your code.

## Development branches

You should base your pull requests on one of the following branches
depending on the kind of change you are making:

#### Bug Fixes
   - Branch: `bugfix` 
   - Label: **[branch] bugfix** 
   - Content: Generally these changes do not require SQL scripts
   and are concise with the sole objective to correct a single problem
   in the code.

#### Minor Changes and Small Features
   - Branch: `minor` 
   - Label: **[branch] minor** 
   - Content: Features affecting self-contained components such
   as modules. Additions to Libraries, API, or modules that do not change
   any function signatures.

#### Major Changes, Non Backwards-Compatible Changes and Large Features
   - Branch: `major` 
   - Label: **[branch] major** 
   - Content: Any change modifying a function signature in a
   library class. Features require extensive LORIS-wide testing. New
   complex systems and features spanning across multiple modules and
   libraries. Deprecated functions clean-up.

For more information about making well-organized pull requests,
please read our in-depth Wiki page, 
["Contributing to the Code"](https://github.com/aces/Loris/wiki/Contributing-to-the-Code).

## Pull Request Title and Description

To make it easier for reviewers to locate pull requests with which they have
expertise, we request that new pull requests follow a few conventions.

#### Title

The title should begin with square brackets enclosing the name of the
module that you are changing followed by a brief description.

e.g. This is a well-formed title. 

> [Imaging Uploader / Server Process Manager] Fix invalid upload state

If you are instead editing the `Core` libraries or the `tools` directory,
etc., you can supply these values in place of a module name.

There should be plenty of other examples in the list of pull requests
in the main code repository.

#### Description

When opening a pull request on GitHub you will see a pull request
template. Please fill out each heading with detailed information on your
code changes, suggested testing instructions, and links to open GitHub
issues and/or Redmine tickets (if applicable).

## Some Things To Keep In Mind

* If your changes require any table modifications:
    1. Review our [SQL standard](./docs/SQLModelingStandard.md).
    2. Modify the `SQL/0000*.sql` file(s) with your changes. These patches
    are applied during the LORIS install.  
    3. Include a patch to be used by existing projects. These should go in the 
    `SQL/New_patches/` directory.
    4. For SQL patches that are _optional_ (e.g. those that perform some 
            cleanup), place them in `SQL/Cleanup_patches/`.
* Include a test for any new module in the `modules/MODULENAME/test/`
  directory. You can look at other modules for examples of how to
  write tests.
* Add your new automated tests to TravisCI in the `.travis.yml`.
* Before sending any pull request, make sure you run our static analysis tools 
using the command `make checkstatic` and fix any resulting errors. Otherwise,
      your pull request will fail our automatic testing and we will not be able
      to merge it.
* Try and make all changes backwards-compatible with existing installations.  
* If you must change something in a non-backwards-compatible way - or if it 
would affect the data or custom code of a study - document this in your pull 
request description and tag it with **Caveat for Existing Projects**. 
This helps us to document our release notes.

If you're unsure about any of the above, feel free to ask us for
clarification via the mailing list.

## Getting Started

If you're looking for ideas for a way to contribute but don't know where
to begin, here are some ideas to get you started:

* You can browse some of our public
[Issues](https://github.com/aces/Loris/issues). Issues tagged with **Beginner
Friendly** are good ones to tackle if you are new to LORIS development.
* You can help improve our documentation if you find any parts of it
confusing or lacking.
* You can track down bugs by browsing the application and reviewing the
PHP error log.
