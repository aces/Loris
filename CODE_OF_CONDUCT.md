LORIS is primarily developed at [McGill University](https://www.mcgill.ca/) within the [McGill Centre For Integrative Neuroscience](http://mcin.ca/). As such, we are governed by the McGill Faculty of Medicine's [code of conduct](https://www.mcgill.ca/medicine/about/our-vision-mission-values/code-conduct).

The LORIS project also pushes certain philosophies such as:

1) An environment of inclusion

2) A respectful manner of discourse and disagreement

3) A strong commitment to timely resolution of issues

4) An open and free environment to voice opinions and suggestions

5) Having the goal of transparency and clarity

As open source software we encourage contributions from other sources, and as such we need to allow for heterogeneous ideas. When interacting within the LORIS community keep in mind that we are a diverse community incorporating people of many different backgrounds, and it is expected that everyone be treated with respect.
