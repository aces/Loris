LORIS is primarily developed at [McGill University](https://www.mcgill.ca/) within
the [McGill Centre For Integrative Neuroscience](http://mcin.ca/). Contributors
should comply with all relevant policies and codes of their respective organizations.

However, as open source software we encourage contributions from other sources.
When interacting within the LORIS community keep in mind that we are a diverse
community incorporating people of many different backgrounds, and it is expected
that everyone be treated with respect. When disagreements arise, it should be assumed
that the other party is acting in good faith and shares the same goal of making LORIS
the best software possible.
