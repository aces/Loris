# Security Policy, ACE lab projects

## Reporting a vulnerability

Please report security vulnerabilities by email to the lead developers and maintainers
at the ACE lab. We have set up an email address specifically for this purpose:

  [security@mcin.ca](mailto:security@mcin.ca)

You can use this email address for reporting anything of a sensitive nature,
for all the main projects ([CBRAIN](https://github.com/aces/cbrain), [LORIS](https://github.com/aces/Loris) etc)
or any of the other sub projects. For general issues that do not have a sensitive nature, please
use the standard issue trackers of each repository.

We will get back to you by email to acknowledge the report and maybe ask for more information.

Thank you,

The ACE lab development team.
