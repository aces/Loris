This directory contains SQL patches necessary during the upgrade of LORIS. Upon release, the SQL patches concerned will be concatenated into a single release patch stored under the `SQL/Release_patches` directory. The files used for the concatenation are then moved to the `SQL/Archive/X.Y` directory. These patches are necessary for each release and the concatenated version should always be run in parallel to the code changes.
