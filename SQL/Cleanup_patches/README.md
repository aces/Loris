This directory contains SQL patches written for post-release cleanup. These patches can contain `ALTER TABLE`, `DELETE` and/or `DROP` statements. These patches should be run at the discretion of the projects with the full knowledge of the possible side effects of these patches. The content of these patches should not be mandotory for proper functioning of the database, they should be run for the sole purpose of removing unused tables, columns, rows or fields; any mandatory cleanup should be added to the release patches.
