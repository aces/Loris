Click the \“Run Query\” button to execute the current query on the database based on the defined fields and filters. Results can be also sorted by field by clicking on the table\'s column headers. The number of results displayed per page can be modified using the \“Maximum rows per page dropdown\” at the bottom of the results table. \r\n\r\n After running a query and viewing the results, click the \"Download Table Data as CSV\" button to save the query output dataset to your computer as a comma-separated value file. If any files are included in the query output, click \"Download Data as ZIP\" to save compressed packages of the files and data to your computer. \r\n\r\n The query can also be saved for reuse, to avoid constructing the query from scratch in future. Go to the \“Manage Saved Queries\” tab and then click the \"Save Query\" button. A pop-up dialog will appear. Enter a descriptive query name. If you would like the query to be publicly shared, click on the checkbox. Then click \"Save query\" to complete the process, and the currently defined fields and filters will be saved under the specified query name. \r\n\r\n This saved query should now appear under the \"Manage Saved Queries\" tab in the \“Your currently saved queries\” table. New fields can be selected and saved under the same name to directly update the current query. See the help section for \"Saved Queries\" for further information on actions that can be performed on these previously created queries. \r\n\r\n <b>Manage Saved Queries</b> \r\n The \“Manage Saved Queries\” tab organizes new or previously saved queries. The query name, selected fields and filters for each saved query are displayed in the table. Clicking on any column header (e.g. \"Query Name\") will sort the list by that column. \r\n\r\n The current query can be saved by clicking the \"Save Current Query\" button. A pop-up dialog will appear. Enter a descriptive query name. If you would like the query to be publicly shared, click on the checkbox. Then click \"Save query\" to complete the process, and the currently defined fields and filters will be saved under the specified query name. This saved query should now appear under the \"Manage Saved Queries\" tab in the \“Your currently saved queries\” table. New fields can be selected and saved under the same name to directly update the current query. \r\n\r\n To reload a saved query, click on the \"Load Saved Query\" tab. User Saved Queries and Shared Saved Queries will appear in a dropdown. User Saved Queries are queries that the current user has saved, and are listed according to Query Name. Shared Saved Queries are publicly shared, and are listed according to the user who created it and the Query Name. Once a query is selected, the DQT will retrieve and load the query fields and filters that were selected when the query was initially created. This will be displayed under the \“Define Fields\” and \“Define Filters\” tabs, respectively.  \r\n','2016-04-01 00:00:00', NULL),
