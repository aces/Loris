Within each tab, all fields or only a selection of Summary fields can be viewed by toggling the Display select box.  One-click download of the current dataview is also available. 
The Profiles tab displays all genetic data and files stored in Loris per candidate, and enables application of filters. 
The GWAS, SNP, CNV and Methylation tabs enable filtering and exploration of analysis-specific datasets performed on a candidate population.
The Files tab displays all genetic filesets available for download, and provides upload functionality for Methylation data (LORIS 16.0). Clicking on a fileset name will load a subpage displaying the metadata available for this file, as well enabling its download. " WHERE topic = 'Genomic Browser';
