The Access Profile module, also found under the Candidate menu, allows the user to efficiently search for an existing candidate and access the related data. \r\n\r\nThere are 3 main ways to search for a candidate:\r\n\r\n<u>Option 1:</u> Using PSCID and DCCID\r\nA specific candidate profile can be accessed directly by entering both the PSCID and the DCCID in the white boxes to the right of the screen and then clicking the button \"Open Profile\". In a narrow browser window or mobile device the PSCID and DCCID fields are found below the selection filter.\r\n\r\n<u>Option 2:</u> Basic Filter Options\r\nUsers may search for particular candidates by selecting from the \"Basic\" filter options. Users may select from drop-down select boxes, and then click \"Show Data\" to view a list of candidates. If only a fragment of the candidate ID is known, the user may search for the profile by entering the known fragment, and then click show data to find the appropriate profile. For example, searching with \"531\" under \"DCCID\" will retrieve the profile of candidate DCC1107 (with full DCCID 531861).\r\n\r\n<u>Option 3:</u> Advanced Filter Options\r\nMore detailed filter options can be accessed by clicking on the \"Advanced\" button. Users will select from a number of drop-down select boxes including Site, Project, Subproject, Gender etc., and then click \"Show Data\" to view a list of candidates. To return to \"Basic\" selection filters please select \"Basic\".\r\n\r\nTo view a specific candidate’s dataset, click on the candidate’s PSCID found in blue text under the \"PSCID\" column. At the top of the table, column headings will appear underlined and show a click icon when the user hovers over the heading title. Data can be sorted in ascending order according to a given column by clicking on the column heading (i.e. DCCID, Site, PSCID etc.), and by clicking again, in descending order. In both standard and mobile view, the selection filter can be hidden by selecting the upward arrow icon, allowing easier viewing of the data. Once in this view, users can click on the downward arrow icon to display the features of the selection filter once again. This feature applies to all pages that include a Selection Filter.\r\nNote that the form remembers previously selected data such that when the user returns to the \"Access Profile\" page, the selection filter will automatically select profiles according to the last selection settings. Depending on the magnitude of the search, there may be several pages of search results for the user to look through. If \"No candidates found\" appears, this indicates no profiles matched the information specified by the selection filter(s). \r\nWhen on a mobile device or narrow browser window, the table will have a slider at the bottom of the table, facilitating scrolling of the data. The user may also hover or click the arrows that flank the table to see the remainder of the table. When scrolling through search results, the PSCID column will freeze and remain displayed on the lefthand side, to allow for easy reference and access to relevant information.'
