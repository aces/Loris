  SET content = 'The Data Query Tool (DQT) allows users to query the LORIS database for any given project and download combined demographic, clinical/behavioral, imaging, genomic and QC datasets. Custom queries can be built, saved, and re-run.\r\n\r\nTabs in the Data Query Tool:\r\n\r\n- <b>Info</b>\r\n  - Displays the time of last data cache update, and summarizes the other DQT tabs\r\n- <b>Define Fields</b>\r\n  - Select the data fields across all instruments and categories of data, specify timepoints to be queried for each field.\r\n- <b>Define Filters</b>\r\n  - Target a population of interest by defining filter criteria on any field.\r\n- <b>View Data</b>\r\n  - Run the query, view the data table of results, and download data as well as imaging files.\r\n- <b>Statistical Analysis</b>\r\n  - Run basic statistical calculations and visualize distributions of data results.\r\n- <b>Load Saved Query</b>\r\n  - Load a previously saved query by selecting from this menu.\r\n- <b>Manage Saved Queries</b>\r\n  - Save the current query, and review previously saved queries.\r\n\r\n<b>Define Fields</b>\r\nUnder the "Define Fields" tab, select the data categories and specific data fields to include in your query. Select an instrument or category in the “Instrument” dropdown menu to display available fields.  Field names and descriptions will be displayed in a table below.  Note that additional fields will be displayed on subsequent pages of the table data. Click on a field to highlight and add it to the query.  Selected fields for the query will be listed at the right side of the page. By default, all relevant timepoints will be queried for this field; to remove a timepoint from the query for this field, uncheck the visit label checkbox by the field name.\r\nClick the “Clear Query” button to clear all previously selected fields for a query.\r\nSearch for an instrument data field by keyword by selecting the instrument, then enter keywords in the “Search within Instrument” box. Add or remove all instrument fields to a query by clicking “Add All” or “Remove All”.\r\n\r\nNote: To load a pre-defined query, click on the “Load Saved Query” tab and select your query by name.  This will populate both the fields and filters as defined in the saved query.  Then proceed to the View Data tab to run and download your query results.\r\n\r\n<b>Define Filters</b>\r\nDefine your population or data collection of interest by creating filters for your query.  Filters can be applied on any field in order to limit the set of results returned by a query. For example, you can extract data collected only at one specific site or from a particular visit. Filters can be applied with either "And" or "Or" logic, including nested logic.\r\n\r\nTo add a filter, select the instrument or category, then dropdown menus will appear after each proceeding selection including the instrument field, the rule function (“>” or “contains”) and a value for comparison.\r\n\r\nRule functions are:\r\n<b>=</b>  equal to\r\n<b>!=</b> does not equal\r\n<b><=</b> less than or equal to\r\n<b>>=</b> greater than or equal to\r\n<b>startsWith:</b> filter for values starting with a specific character or string\r\n<b>contains:</b>  filter for values containing a specific character or substring\r\n\r\nTo add additional filters, click the "Add Rule" button and follow the instructions above. To delete any unwanted filters, click the "Delete" button within the specific filter.\r\n\r\nBy default, the filters will be applied using "And" logic. ("And" logic requires that all filters must be satisfied to return a query record.  "Or" will return a result if only one filter condition is satisfied.)\r\nClick on the “Or” button to modify a filter.  To nest filters within a new filter group, click the "Add Group" button. This allows you to have nested filters using both "And" and "Or" logical operators.\r\n\r\n<b>View Data</b>\r\nThe "View Data" tab executes queries on the database, displays query results, and allows users to download data and imaging files. Select the mode of display (cross-sectional or longitudinal) and click the “Run Query” button.  .\r\n\r\nFrom the results table below, users have the option of downloading data as a .csv file by clicking "Download Table Data as CSV" button.. If any files are included in the query output, click "Download Data as ZIP" to save compressed packages of the files and data.\r\nThe query can also be saved for reuse, to avoid constructing the query from scratch in future. Go to the "Manage Saved Queries" tab and then click the "Save Query" button. A pop-up panel will appear. Enter a descriptive query name. To make the query visible and runnable by all study users, click the “Public query” checkbox before clicking “Save Query”.\r\nThis saved query should now appear under the "Manage Saved Queries" tab in the "Your currently saved queries" table. Saved queries can be updated with further fields and filters if desired. .\r\n\r\n<b>Manage Saved Queries</b>\r\nThe "Manage Saved Queries" tab organizes new or previously saved queries.\r\nTo reload a saved query, click on the "Load Saved Query" tab.\r\nThere are 2 types of Saved Queries: User Saved queries are private for the user’s viewing only.\r\nShared Saved Queries are publicly shared within the LORIS database.\r\nOnce a query is selected, the DQT will retrieve and load the query fields and filters that were selected when the query was initially created. This will be displayed under the "Define Fields" and "Define Filters" tabs, respectively.', created = '2017-08-29 00:00:00'
