  SET content = 'The Imaging Browser allows users to browse and view candidate scan sessions collected at time-points (visits) across the study. \r\n\r\n<b>Searching for a candidate’s scans</b>\r\nUse the Selection Filter panel to specify search criteria such as candidate PSCID, DCCID, Visit Label, Site, Quality Control (QC) status of the scanning session, and any Sequence Type (T1, T2, DTI) in the scan session. As well, users may filter for scans that are New (recently inserted), Pending (awaiting QC review), or both. \r\nAfter specifying search criteria in the selection filters, click “Show Data” to display results in the data table below, with one row per relevant scanning session. Click “Clear Form” to reset all selection filters. \r\n\r\nSort the data table results by clicking on any column header.   The date of first acquisition of all scans for the timepoint is indicated under the “First Acq Date” column.  The “Last QC” column shows the date of the most recent Quality Control (QC) on any scan in the session. New scans awaiting Quality Control (QC) will be marked “NEW” (in red) under the “New Data” column. \r\n\r\nTo download, visualize, add QC annotation or view details of imaging files for a candidate-timepoint, select a dataset type the “Links” columns: “native”, “selected” (best scan quality), or “all types”.. "Native" will show only raw imaging datasets, "Selected" displays only scans flagged by QC as having the best scan quality, and "all types" displays all data, including analyzed outputs. By clicking on any of these links, the user will be able to see details for that specific candidate’s dataset from a given scan session.', created = '2017-08-29 00:00:00'
