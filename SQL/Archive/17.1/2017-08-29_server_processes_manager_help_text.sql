This column will be empty until the process terminates.\r\n  - Userid: the LORIS username of the user that launched the asynchronous process.\r\n  - Start time: time (on the LORIS server) at which the process was started.\r\n  - End time: time (on the LORIS server) at which the process ended. Will be empty until the process finishes.\r\n  - Exit text: summary text describing the process execution result. Will be empty until the process finishes.\r\n\r\nThe Server Processes Manager page provides a Selection Filter that can be used to display only specific processes. Filtering can be performed based on the PID, type of process or user ID.\r\nFinally, note that when a process finishes, all temporary files used store metadata are available for this file.', created = '2017-08-29 00:00:00'
