A brief description of “Demographic”, “Imaging”, and “Behavioural Statistics” can be found under the “General Description” tab. In addition to these tabs, the user can also view “Reliability Statistics”. These statistics categories will condense into a drop-down menu in a narrow browser view or mobile device, but can be opened using the downward arrow icon and hidden using the upward arrow icon.\r\n\r\n<b>Demographic Statistics</b>\r\nGeneral statistics can be retrieved from each site by using the drop-down select box under the first smaller heading “General Statistics” and clicking on the button “Submit Query”. Under General Statistics, the user will find the heading “Breakdown of Registered Candidates”, where a table outlines gender breakdowns per site, time-point and subproject ID. Data Entry Completion Status can be viewed for each instrument by selecting from the dropdown menu under “Breakdown of Registered Candidates”. Click “Submit Query” to view statistics specific to the selected instrument. \r\n\r\n<b>Behavioural Statistics</b>\r\nThe user will first see a table labeled “Data Entry Statistics”, where each site is listed in blue headers horizontally and includes the headings “Completed”, “Created”, and “% Completion”. “Completed” refers to the total number of instruments that have been marked “Data Entry= Complete” and “Administration= None/Partial/All”. This column has its percentage counterpart under “% Completion”. “Created” refers to the total number of instruments that have been populated requiring data entry. Another feature allows all site information to be reversibly hidden except “% Completion” by a single click on the Site Name (i.e. AAA, DCC etc.). The “Double Data Entry Statistics” table underneath rests on a similar premise as the “Data Entry Statistics” Table, but with regards to double data entry. In both of these tables, the visits are listed in rows with the data sorted by site. Depending on the study and number of sites involved, the user will need to navigate horizontally through the table using the slider or the arrows flanking the table. When using a desktop the user must hover the mouse over the arrows, whereas on a mobile device the user must click on the arrows. The user also has the option of viewing “Per Instrument Stats” at the bottom of each site’s column, by following the “Please Click Here” link. The user can then view which candidates have not completed data entry in each site. \r\n\r\n<b>Reliability Statistics</b>\r\nThe Reliability Statistics module currently sorts each instrument by visit label and shows the number of flagged, completed, and reliable cases, in addition to expressing reliability and completion in terms of percentages. “Total Flagged” cases refer to the number of candidates with levels consistently falling below a given threshold, thus they have been ‘flagged’ for reliability review. The “Total Complete” column contains the number of candidates for whom a reliability review has been completed. The “Total Reliable” column adds to the information in “Total Complete”, but includes only those candidates whose information is now reliable. The Reliability Statistics Table also includes “Percent Complete” and “Percent Reliable” columns. Under the smaller navy heading “Reliability Statistics”, the user can search for specific statistics for their site of interest by using the dropdown menu and clicking the button “Submit Query”.\r\n\r\n<b>Imaging Statistics</b>\r\nThe first table under “Imaging Integrity Statistics for” displays information regarding missing imaging data, as indicated by data entry on the MRI parameter form, and scan insertions based on records in the Imaging Browser and DICOM archive. Specific candidates with missing imaging data can be easily identified through the link “Click here for breakdown per participant” under the “Breakdown of Problems” column.\r\n\r\nThe second table within the Imaging Statistics module allows the user to get a breakdown of statistics for candidates by time-point, based on the scan selected. Depending on the project, the user can choose from T1, T2, T1 & T2, DTI, BOLD, and Spectroscopy scans, and other possible options at the top left of the second table, to show the relative number of candidates with scans marked as “Complete”, “Partial”, or “No Scan”. Under the column “% Complete”, the user can view the percentage of candidates for the scan of interest that have completed scans. The record of scans has the subprojects listed across the top of the table horizontally, with each site encompassing all of its time points listed in rows.

The “Link to Bvl Feedback” column contains links to pop-up feedback windows, where feedback for a particular field and candidate was previously entered.
