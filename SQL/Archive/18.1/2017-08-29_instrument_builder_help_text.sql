Text will appear in boldface, centered on the screen.\r\n- <i>Label:</i> Descriptive text or instructions in the form.\r\n- <i>Scored Field:</i> Any field that will store a value to be calculated by database logic or code.

Once "Dropdown" is selected, the user will see an added row labeled as "Dropdown option". Once the option has been entered, press "add option". This new option should appear in the "preview" menu. Note The field "not_answered" will be automatically added to each set of dropdown field options. Once all options have been added, click "Add row" to add this element to the form.  The last dropdown options will be remembered and suggested for subsequent dropdown fields. To clear the previous options from a new dropdown question, click "reset".\r\n- <i>Multiselect:</i> Multiple options may be selected from the options available.\r\n- <i>Date:</i> Used for creating a date field such as Date of Birth\r\n- <i>Numeric:</i> Used for creating a numeric field such as Height, Weight, etc.  Decimals are allowed\r\n\r\n<u>Formatting</u>\r\n- <i>Blank Line:</i> For separating sections within the same page of an instrument. The "Question Name" and "Question Text" can be left blank for this type of field.\r\n- <i>Page Break:</i> Used to add a new page within the instrument. The "Question Text" can be populated with the name of the new page, if desired.\r\n\r\n<b>Note on Question Names:</b>\r\n"Question Name" is the field name as it appears (only) in the back-end of the database table.  It must be unique within the instrument, should not contain spaces (underscore recommended), and is ideally formatted beginning with “q01_…”\r\nThe "Question Text" will be seen by instrument data entry users.\r\n\r\nAfter each new question entry, click "add row" to add the field to the instrument form. Once the question has been added to the form, it will appear in the table above in the page.  Click “Edit” or “Delete” on each form field to modify or remove the field.\r\n\r\nIf a mistake was made while creating the instrument, users can directly edit the field names in the table at the bottom of the page. By clicking on the field name, a cursor should appear. The user can then make the appropriate changes and hit enter once finished. It is also possible to rearrange or delete fields using the "Options" column.\r\n\r\nOnce the user is satisfied with their instrument, they must click the “Save” tab where they will be prompted to provide a name for the instrument’s filename and the Instrument Name. Once this information has been entered, users must click “Save” to finalize the creation of their instrument.', created = '2017-08-29 00:00:00'
