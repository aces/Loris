LORIS' Provenance is published in the following documentation: 
* LORIS Governance Framework: [[https://loris.ca/LORIS_Governance_1904.pdf]]
* [Contributing.md](https://github.com/aces/Loris/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) describes how to make code contributions. 

Our core development team reviews all pull requests and ensures testing is performed to ensure integrity, consistency and alignment of contributions across the LORIS codebase. In addition to automated tests, several rounds of manual testing are performed according to module test plans, on both synthetic and real research data in preparation for our periodic codebase releases. The LORIS group also collectively plans roadmap features and performs extensive release upgrade testing using best practices to ensure adequate backwards compatibility with a minimum of risk to the stability of research data platforms using our software.
