The BMI instrument was created using the Instrument builder module under the Admin
module. There are three files associated with the BMI instrument:
1. bmi.linst : Output file from the instrument builder.
2. bmi.rules : File that contains the rules for data entry for the instrument
3. bmi.score : Scoring file written in php that will calculate the bmi for a person
               given a height and weight

All three files should be put in project/instruments directory.
