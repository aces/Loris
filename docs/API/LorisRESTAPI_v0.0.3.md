# Loris API - v0.0.0-dev
## 1.0 Overview

This document specifies the Loris REST API.

Any request sent to `$LorisRoot/api/$APIVERSION/$API_CALL` will return either a JSON object
or no data. The Loris API uses standard HTTP error codes and the body of any response will
either be empty or contain only a JSON object for any request.

For brevity, the `$LorisRoot/api/$APIVERSION` is omitted from the definitions in this
document. This document specifies $APIVERSION v0.0.3-dev and it
MUST be included before the request in all requests.

HTTP GET requests NEVER modify data. PUT, POST or PATCH requests MUST be used to modify
data as per their definitions in the HTTP/1.1 specification. Any methods not supported
will respond with a 405 Method Not Allowed response and an appropriate Allow header set (as
per HTTP documentation.)

PUT requests either create or overwrite all data for a given resource (instrument/
candidate/visit/etc.) Any fields not explicitly specified in the PUT request are nulled.

PATCH requests are identical to PUT requests, but any fields not explicitly mentioned are
unmodified from their current value.

All GET requests include an ETag header. If a PUT or PATCH request is sent and it does
not include an ETag, or the ETag does not match the currently existing ETag for that resource,
it will result in a 403 Forbidden response. PUT or POST requests used for the creation of resources
do not require ETags.

DELETE is not supported on any resource defined in this API.

### 1.1 Authentication

If a user is logged in to Loris and can be authenticated using the standard session mechanism,
no further authentication is required. Requests will be evaluated as requests from that user,
so that standard Loris modules can simply use the API.

If a user is not logged in to Loris (for instance, in a third party app or a CORS application),
they can be authenticated using [JSON Web Tokens](https://jwt.io).

The client should POST a request to /login with a payload of the form:

```js
{
    "username" : username,
    "password" : password
}
```

If the username and password are valid, the API will respond with a 200 OK and payload
of the form:

```js
{
    "token" : /* JWT token */
}
```

Otherwise, it will return a 401 Unauthorized response.

If the token is returned, it should be included in an "Authorization: Bearer token" header
for any future requests to authenciate the request.

## 2.0 Project API

The Project API lives under the /projects portion of the API URL hierarchy. It is used to get
project specific settings or data. PUT and PATCH are not currently supported for the part of
the API living under /projects.

```
GET /projects
```

Will return a list of projects in this Loris instance. There is no corresponding PUT or PATCH
request. The JSON returned is of the form:

```js
{
    "Projects" : {
        "ProjectName1" : {
            "useEDC" : boolean,
            "PSCID" : PSCIDSettings
        },
        "ProjectName2" : {
            "useEDC" : boolean,
            "PSCID" : PSCIDSettings
        },
        ...
}
```

If the Loris instance does not use projects, the API will return a single project called "loris"
with the appropriate settings for the Loris instance.

useEDC represents a boolean determining whether the EDC date should be included
in candidates returned by the API.

PSCID represents a JSON object with the configuration settings for PSCIDs in this
project.

It has the form:

```js
{
    "Type" : "prompt|auto",
    "Regex" : "/regex/"
}
```

Where regex is a regular expression that can be used to validate a PSCID for this project.

If the type is "prompt", the user should be prompted to enter the PSCID for new candidates.
If the type is "auto", the server will automatically generate the PSCID.

Note that sometimes in Loris configurations "Site" is a part of the PSCID. This will be
denoted by the string "SITE{1,1}" inside of the regex returned. This string should be replaced
by the 3 letter site alias before attempting to pass this regex to a regular expression parser
or it will result in false negatives.


### 2.1 Single project 

```
GET /projects/$ProjectName
```

Returns a 200 OK response if the project exists, and 404 Not Found if it does not (the same is
true of any portion of the API under /projects/$ProjectName.)

The body of the request to /projects/$ProjectName will be an entity of the form:

```js
{
    "Meta" : {
        "Project" : "ProjectName"
    },
    "Visits" : ["V1", "V2", ... ],
    "Instruments" : ["InstrumentName", "InstrumentName2", ...],
    "Candidates" : ["123543", "523234", ...]
}
```

#### 2.1.1 Single project images  
```
GET /projects/$ProjectName/images/
```

Will return a JSON object of the form:

```js
{
  "Images" : [
    {
      "Candidate": "123456",
      "PSCID": "MTL001",
      "Visit": "V1",
      "Visit_date": "2016-08-09", /* The date of the session. This will be null for phantoms and session that are not yet started */
      "Site": "Montreal Neurological Institute",
      "ScanType": "t2", /* Acquisition protocol */
      "QC_status": "Pass|Fail|null",
      "Selected": "true|false|null",
      "Link": "\/candidates\/300022\/V1\/images\/loris-MRI_123456_V1_t2_001.mnc", /* URL relative to this API */
      "InsertTime": "2016-08-09T14:15:30-05:00" /* The inserted date ISO 8601 */
    },
    ...
  ]
}
```
It is possible to provide a GET parameter named `since` where the value need to be a date or datetime.
```
ex: 2016-08-09 or 2016-08-09 10:00:00 or 2016-08-09T10:00:00-05:00
```
We recommend using a format that includes timezone.

#### 2.1.2 Single project instruments  
```
GET /projects/$ProjectName/instruments/
```

Will return a JSON object of the form:

```js
{
    "Meta" : {
        "Project" : "ProjectName"
    },
    "Instruments": {
        "InstrumentName" : {
            "FullName" :  "Long Name",
            "Subgroup" : "Subgroup Name",
            "DoubleDataEntryEnabled" : boolean
        },
        "Instrument2" : {
            "FullName" :  "Long Name",
            "Subgroup" : "Subgroup Name",
            "DoubleDataEntryEnabled" : boolean
        },
        ...
    }
}
```

Where the InstrumentNames are the "Short Name" of all the instruments used/installed in this project.

#### 2.1.3 Single project visits  
```
GET /projects/$ProjectName/visits/
```

Will return a JSON object of the form:

```js
{
    "Meta" : {
        "Project" : "ProjectName"
    },
    "Visits" : ["V1", "V2", ... ],
}
```

Where V1, V2, ... are the visits that may exist for this project

#### 2.1.4 Single project candidates  
```
GET /projects/$ProjectName/candidates/
```

will return a JSON object of the form:

```js
{
    "Meta" : {
        "Project" : "ProjectName"
    },
    "Candidates" : ["123456", "342332", ... ],
}
```

where 123456, 342332, etc are the candidates that exist for this project.

### 2.2 Instrument Forms

```
GET /projects/$ProjectName/instruments/$InstrumentName
```

Will return a 200 response on success and 404 Not Found if $InstrumentName is not a
valid instrument for this instance of Loris.

This will return a JSON representation of the instrument form. If available, rules and form will
be combined into a single JSON object. The format for the JSON returned is specified in the
accompanying InstrumentFormat.md and RulesFormat.md documents. The JSON document can be used
to render the form by a client.

PUT and PATCH are not supported for instrument forms.

Methods for getting/putting data into specific candidates are specified in section 3.

## 3.0 Candidate API

The /candidate portion of the API is used for retrieving and modifying candidate data and
data attached to a specific candidate or visit such as visits or instrument data. Portions
of this reference a CandidateObject. A CandidateObject is a JSON object of the form:

```js
{
        "CandID"  : CandID,
        "Project" : ProjectName,
        "PSCID"   : PSCID,
        "Site"    : Site,
        "EDC"     : "YYYY-MM-DD",
        "DoB"     : "YYYY-MM-DD",
        "Sex"     : "Male|Female"
}
```

representing a candidate in Loris.

```
GET /candidates/
```

will return a JSON object of the form:

```js
{
    "Candidates" : [CandidateObject1, CandidateObject2, CandidateObject3, ...]
}
```

containing ALL candidates present in this Loris instance.

A new candidate can be created by sending a POST request to /candidates.

The body of the POST request should be a candidate key with a JSON object of the form:

```js
{
    "Candidate" : {
        "Project" : ProjectName,
        "PSCID"   : PSCID,
        "EDC"     : "YYYY-MM-DD",
        "DoB"     : "YYYY-MM-DD",
        "Sex"     : "Male|Female",
        "Site"    : SiteName,
    }
}
```

EDC is only required if useEDC is enabled for the project according to the
project settings.

PSCID is only required if the generation type in the Loris config is set to
"prompt".

A response code of 201 Created will be returned on success, 409 Conflict if
the PSCID already exists, 403 Forbidden when the user is creating a candidate at 
a site other than the list of sitenames the user is affiliated with, and a 400 
Bad Request if any data provided is invalid (PSCID format, date format, sex
something other than Male|Female, invalid project name, invalid sitename, etc). 
A successful POST request will return a CandidateObject for the newly created 
candidate.

PUT / PATCH methods are not supported on /candidate in this
version of the Loris API.

### 3.1 Specific Candidate

If a GET request for a candidate is issued such as

```
GET /candidates/$CandID
```

A JSON object representing that candidate will be returned.

The JSON object is of the form:

```js
{
    "Meta" : CandidateObject,
    "Visits" : ["V1", "V2", ...]
}
```

where V1, V2, etc are the visit labels that are registered for this
candidate.

PUT / PATCH are not supported for candidates in this version of the
API.

It will return a 200 OK on success, a 404 if the candidate does not exist, and
a 400 Bad Request if the CandID is invalid (not a 6 digit integer). The same is
true of all of the API hierarchy under /candidates/$CandID.

### 3.2 Getting Candidate visit data

A GET request of the form:

```
GET /candidates/$CandID/$VisitLabel
```

Will return a JSON object of the metadata for that candidate's visit.

The JSON object is of the form:

```js
{
    "Meta" : {
        "CandID" : CandID,
        "Visit"  : VisitLabel,
        "Site"   : SiteName,
        "Battery": "NameOfSubproject"
    },
    "Stages" : {
        "Screening" :  {
            "Date" : "YYYY-MM-DD",
            "Status" : "Pass|Failure|Withdrawal|In Progress"
        },
        "Visit" : {
            "Date" : "YYYY-MM-DD",
            "Status" : "Pass|Failure|Withdrawal|In Progress"
        },
        "Approval" : {
            "Date" : "YYYY-MM-DD",
            "Status" : "Pass|Failure|Withdrawal|In Progress"
        }
    }
}
```

A PUT of the same format but with only the Meta fields will create the VisitLabel
for this candidate, in an unstarted stage if the Visit label provided is valid.

PATCH is not supported for Visit Labels.

It will return a 404 Not Found if the visit label does not exist for this candidate
(as well as anything under the /candidates/$CandID/$VisitLabel hierarchy)

Any of the Stages may not be present in the returned result if the stage has not
started yet or is not enabled for this project (ie. if useScreening is false in
Loris, or Approval has not occurred)

### 3.3 Candidate Instruments
```
GET /candidates/$CandID/$VisitLabel/instruments
```

Will return a JSON object of the form:

```js
{
    "Meta" : {
        "CandID" : CandID,
        "Visit"  : VisitLabel
    },
    "Instruments" : [ "InstrumentName", "AnotherInstrument", ...]
}
```

Where the instruments array represents the instruments that were administered for that
candidate at that visit. InstrumentNames are the short names and the forms for them
SHOULD all be retrievable through the `project` portion of the API.

PUT / PATCH / POST are not currently supported for candidate instruments.

#### 3.3.1 The Candidate Instrument Data

```
GET /candidates/$CandID/$VisitLabel/instruments/$InstrumentName[/dde]
PUT /candidates/$CandID/$VisitLabel/instruments/$InstrumentName[/dde]
PATCH /candidates/$CandID/$VisitLabel/instruments/$InstrumentName[/dde]
```

These will retrieve or modifiy the data for $InstrumentName. If /dde is present, the double data
entry form of the data will be retrieved/modified. If absent, the "single data entry" version
of the form is used instead.

The format returned by a GET request is a JSON document of the form:

```js
{
    "Meta" : {
        "Instrument" : $InstrumentName,
        "Visit" : $VisitLabel,
        "Candidate" : $CandID,
        "DDE" : boolean
    },
    "$InstrumentName" : {
        "FieldName1" : "Value1",
        "FieldName2" : "Value2",
        ...
    }
}
```

Including the values of ALL fields for this instrument, including score field values.

The body of a PUT request to the same URL MUST contain a JSON object of the same format. Data PUT
to the URL SHOULD contain all fields with data entry. The server will null the data for keys not
specified. A PUT request MAY not specify score columns that will be calculated/overwriten by
server-side scoring. If the client attempted to score fields client-side and the value passed by the PUT
request conflict with the server-side calculation of the score, the server-side calculation will win.
Any keys specified in the document PUT that do not match a corresponding field in the form MAY be ignored.

The specification for PATCH request is similar to a PUT request, with the exception that any
fields not specified MUST be unmodified by the server rather than nulled. In most cases a series
of PATCH requests SHOULD be used rather than a single PUT request for a client with pagination.

A 200 OK will be returned on success, and a 404 Not Found if $InstrumentName is not a valid instrument installed in this Loris instance.

#### 3.3.2 Instrument Flags
```
GET /candidates/$CandID/$VisitLabel/instruments/$InstrumentName[/dde]/flags
PUT /candidates/$CandID/$VisitLabel/instruments/$InstrumentName[/dde]/flags
PATCH /candidates/$CandID/$VisitLabel/instruments/$InstrumentName[/dde]/flags
```

This URL is used to GET and modify flags for an instrument. The standard GET/PUT/PATCH
rules apply. However, PATCH and PUT requests MUST include the "Meta" attribute and all
fields in it MUST be specified and match the values in the URL, otherwise a "400 Bad request"
error is returned and no data is modified. Like instruments, the [/dde] component is optional
and used to differentiate single data entry and double data entry flags.

The "Validity" flag may be missing, if the ValidityEnabled flag is not true for this instrument.

The format of the JSON object for these URLS is:

```js
{
    "Meta" : {
        "Candidate"  : CandID,
        "Visit"      : VisitLabel,
        "Instrument" : InstrumentName,
        "DDE"        : boolean
    },
    "Flags" : {
        "Data_entry" : "In Progress|Complete",
        "Administration" : "None|Partial|All",
        "Validity" : "Questionable|Invalid|Valid"
    }
}
```

## 4.0 Imaging Data

The imaging data mostly lives in the `/candidates/$CandID/$Visit` portion of the REST API
namespace, but is defined in a separate section of this document for clarity purposes.

### 4.1 Candidate Images
```
GET /candidates/$CandID/$Visit/images
```

A GET request to `/candidates/$CandID/$Visit/images` will return a JSON object of
all the images which have been acquired for that visit. It will return an object of
the form:

```js
{
    "Meta" : {
        "CandID" : $CandID,
        "Visit" : $VisitLabel,
    },
    "Files" : [{
        "OutputType" : "native",
        "Filename" : "abc.mnc",
        "AcquisitionType" : "t1w/t2w/etc",
    }, /* More files */]
}
```

### 4.2 Session Imaging QC
```
GET /candidates/$CandID/$Visit/qc/imaging
PUT /candidates/$CandID/$Visit/qc/imaging
```

To retrieve the session level imaging QC data for a visit, a request can
be made `/candidates/$CandID/$Visit/qc/imaging`. It will return a JSON object
of the form:

```js
{
    "Meta" : {
        "CandID" : $CandID,
        "Visit" : $VisitLabel
    },
   "SessionQC" : "Pass|Fail"
   "Pending" : boolean
}
```

A PUT to the same location will update the QC information. 

### 4.3 Image Level Data
```
GET /candidates/$CandID/$VisitLabel/images/$Filename
```

Returns raw file with the appropriate MimeType headers for each Filename retrieved from
`/candidates/$CandID/$Visit/images`.

Only `GET` is currently supported, but future versions of this API may include `PUT`
support to insert new (or processed) data into LORIS.

#### 4.3.1 Image Level QC Data
```
GET /candidates/$CandID/$VisitLabel/images/$Filename/qc
PUT /candidates/$CandID/$VisitLabel/images/$Filename/qc
```

Returns file level QC information. It will return a JSON object of the form:

```js
{
    "Meta" : {
        "CandID" : $CandID,
        "Visit" : $VisitLabel,
        "File" : $Filename
    },
    "QC" : "Pass|Fail",
    "Selected" : boolean,
    "Caveats" : [
        {
            "Severity" : $severity,
            "Header" : $header,
            "Value" : $headerValue,
            "ValidRange" : $headerValidRange,
            "ValidRegex" : $headerValidRegex
        },
        {
            "Severity" : $severity,
            "Header" : $header,
            "Value" : $headerValue,
            "ValidRange" : $headerValidRange,
            "ValidRegex" : $headerValidRegex
        }
    ]
}
```

`PUT` requests to the same URL will update the QC information.

### 4.4 Alternate formats

There are occasions where you may want to retrieve a file in a different format
than it is stored in LORIS. This can be achieved by adding `/format/$FormatType`
to the URL in the API. Currently supported other formats are below. Other formats
may be added in a future version of this API.

An attempt to convert an image to an unsupported format may result in a
 `415 Unsupported Media Type` HTTP error.

#### 4.4.1 Raw Format
```
GET /candidates/$CandID/$VisitLabel/images/$Filename/format/raw
```

This will return the data in raw format (ie. the output of mnc2raw)

#### 4.4.2 BrainBrowser Format
```
GET /candidates/$CandID/$VisitLabel/images/$Filename/format/brainbrowser
```

This (in combination with raw) will let you extract the headers in a JSON
format that BrainBrowser can load. It will return a JSON object of the format

```js
{
    "xspace": {
        "start":"",
        "space_length":"",
        "step":""},
    "yspace": {
        "start":"",
        "space_length":"",
        "step":""
    },
    "zspace": {
        "start":"",
        "space_length":"",
        "step":""
    },
    "order":["xspace","zspace","yspace"]
}
```

#### 4.4.3 Thumbnail Format
```
GET /candidates/$CandID/$VisitLabel/images/$Filename/format/thumbnail
```

This will return a JPEG image that can be used as a thumbnail to represent this
imaging acquisition statically (such as in the LORIS imaging browser.)

### 4.5 Image Headers
The LORIS API allows you to extract headers from the images in a RESTful manner.
The following methods are defined:

#### 4.5.1 Header Summary
```
GET /candidates/$CandID/$VisitLabel/images/$Filename/headers
```

This will return a JSON summary of the important headers for this filename. It
will return a JSON object of the form:

```js
{
    "Meta" : {
        "CandID" : $CandID,
        "Visit" : $VisitLabel,
        "File" : $Filename
    },
    "Physical" : {
        "TE" : "",
        "TR" : "",
        "TI" : "",
        "SliceThickness" : "",
    },
    "Description" : {
        "SeriesName" : "",
        "SeriesDescription"  : ""
    },
    "Dimensions" : {
        "XSpace" : {
            "Length" : "",
            "StepSize" : ""
        },
        "YSpace" : {
            "Length" : "",
            "StepSize" : ""
        },
        "ZSpace" : {
            "Length" : "",
            "StepSize" : ""
        },
        "TimeDimension" : {
            "Length" : "",
            "StepSize" : ""
        }
    },
    "ScannerInfo" : {
      "Manufacturer" : $scannerManufacturer,
      "Model" : $scannerModel,
      "SoftwareVersion" : $scannerSoftwareVersion,
      "SerialNumber" : $scannerSerialNumber,
      "FieldStrength" : $scannerFieldStrength
    }
}
```

All of the dimensions are optional and may not exist for any given
file (for instance, a 3D image will not have a time dimension.)

#### 4.5.2 Complete Headers
```
GET /candidates/$CandID/$VisitLabel/images/$Filename/headers/full
```

This will return a JSON object with ALL headers for this acquisition. 

The JSON will be of the form:

```js
{
    "Meta" : {
        "CandID" : $CandID,
        "Visit" : $VisitLabel,
        "File" : $Filename
    },
    "Headers" : {
        "dicomheader" : "value",
        /* more headers ... */
    }
}
```

#### 4.5.3 Specific Header
```
GET /candidates/$CandID/$VisitLabel/images/$Filename/headers/$HeaderName
```

This will return a JSON object that extracts one specific header from $Filename.

The JSON object is of the form:
```js
{
    "Meta" : {
        "CandID" : $CandID,
        "Visit" : $VisitLabel,
        "File" : $Filename,
        "Header" : $HeaderName
    },
    "Value" : string
}
```

## 5.0 DICOM Data

Like the imaging data, the DICOM data mostly lives in the `/candidates/$CandID/$Visit` 
portion of the REST API namespace, but is defined in a separate section of this 
document for clarity purposes.

### 5.1 Candidate DICOMs
```
GET /candidates/$CandID/$Visit/dicoms
```

A GET request to `/candidates/$CandID/$Visit/dicoms` will return a JSON object of
all the raw DICOM data which have been acquired for that visit. It will return an 
object of the form:

```js
{
    "Meta" : {
        "CandID" : $CandID,
        "Visit" : $VisitLabel,
    },
    "DicomTars" : 
    [
        {
            "Tarname" : "DCM_yyyy-mm-dd_ImagingUpload-hh-mm-abc123.tar",
            "SeriesInfo" :
                [{
                    "SeriesDescription" : "MPRAGE_ipat2",
                    "SeriesNumber" : "2",
                    "EchoTime" : "2.98",
