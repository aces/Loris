# LORIS meets ReactJS

## 1. Setting up Grunt

In order to run the grunt build step, you will have to install the following dependencies:

* NodeJS
* NPM

### 1.1 Installing dependencies

#### 1.1.1 NodeJS

To check whether or not NodeJS is installed on your machine, run the following:

```
node -v
```

If not installed, use one of the following steps to install for your OS:

##### Ubuntu

For this install you will need sudo rights

```
curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_6.x | sudo -E bash -
sudo apt-get install -y nodejs
sudo apt-get install -y build-essential
```

##### CentOS

```
curl --silent --location https://rpm.nodesource.com/setup_6.x | bash -
yum -y install nodejs
yum install gcc-c++ make
```

##### MacOS

Download the NodeJS package from [here](https://nodejs.org/en/)

#### 1.1.2 NPM

Once NodeJS is installed, use the following to install NPM

```
curl -L https://www.npmjs.com/install.sh | sudo sh
```

### 1.2 Installing Grunt

Once NodeJS and NPM are installed, you are ready to install Webpack. First, ```cd``` into the LORIS home directory in your terminal.
Then run the following command:

```
npm install --only=dev
```

Webpack should now be installed.

## 2. Compiling ES6/JSX

### 2.1 Using Webpack to compile all ES6/JSX

To compile all ES6/JSX files in LORIS, use the following command:

```
npm run compile
```

which is a short-cut for:

```
./node_modules/.bin/webpack
```

You can have webpack watch for changes to all revelant files and compile them on the fly:

```
npm run watch
```

which is a short-cut for:

```
./node_modules/.bin/webpack --watch
```

**NOTE:** If you create a new ES6/JSX file, ensure you add it to the ```webpack.config.js``` file under the ```config.entry``` object with the following format:

```
'./desc/file.js' : './src/file.js'
```

### 2.2 Using Babel to compile ES6/JSX

Typically you won't need to run Babel manually (webpack does it for you) but it may be useful in some cases.

There are four major ways you can compile JSX with Babel. You can compile once or continuously a single or a directory. Using continuous compilation becomes useful when you are constantly making changes to the JSX file.

#### 2.2.1 Compile single file

To compile a single file use the following command:

```
./node_modules/.bin/babel src/file.js --out-file desc/file.js
```

#### 2.2.2 Compile a directory

To compile a directory use the following command:

```
./node_modules/.bin/babel src/ --out-dir desc/
```

#### 2.2.3 Continuously compile single file

To compile a single file continuously use the following command:

```
./node_modules/.bin/babel --watch src/file.js --out-file desc/file.js
```

#### 2.2.4 Continuously compile a directory

To compile a directory continuously use the following command:

```
./node_modules/.bin/babel --watch src/ --out-dir desc/
```

## 3. LORIS JSX file structure

Within LORIS, we have two main ways of adding JSX and their compiled files. When creating a new JSX file **always** use the ```.js```
extension or the continuous compilation will not work as expected. The file name of the JSX and its compiled file should have the
same name.

### 3.1 Adding generic JSX files

Within LORIS we have many React components that can be used throughout the different modules. When adding a new generic file, the
JSX file should be placed in the ```jsx/``` directory and its compiled file in the ```htdocs/js/components``` directory.

### 3.2 Adding module specific JSX files

In many cases, React components are designed for a specific LORIS module. In such cases the JSX file should be placed in the
```module/$DESIRED_MODULE/jsx/``` and its compiled file in the ```module/$DESIRED_MODULE/js/``` directory.
