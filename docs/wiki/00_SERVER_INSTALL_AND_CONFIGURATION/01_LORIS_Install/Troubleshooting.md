# Troubleshooting Common Installation Errors

This guide assumes installation on any supported OS, and was primarily written based on an Ubuntu 18 stack.  

This guide offers support for common issues faced when first installing LORIS. It is assumed that all installation steps provided have been 
correctly followed and that all required dependencies have been installed.

## MySQL 8 and PHP 7.3

If you are running into issues when setting up your MySQL or MySQL user account and you are using MySQL 8 and PHP 7.3 
(instead of PHP 7.4), please read [this link](https://www.php.net/manual/en/mysqli.requirements.php) and also [this](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/upgrading-from-previous-series.html#upgrade-caching-sha2-password-compatible-connectors)

## Frontend Does Not Load/JavaScript changes not visible
The first command to try to run (under the _loris root_ directory):

```bash
make clean
```

Next, run one of the following commands depending on your environment:

```bash
make        # For production environments
make dev    # For development environments
```

If that does not solve your issue, this could be because the Config table in the database is not pointing to the correct values. In this case, follow the following steps. 

1. Check that the following values in the Config table are correct via the SQL backend.

   | Name | Label          | Value          |  
   | ---- | ----------- | ---------- |
   | base | Base           | $lorisRootDirectory |
   | host | Host           | $hostName  | 
    
   These values can be viewed by running the following commands:
    
   ```sql
    SELECT c.configID, cs.Name, cs.Label, c.value, cs.Description FROM Config c LEFT JOIN ConfigSettings cs ON (c.ConfigID = cs.ID) WHERE ConfigID=(SELECT ID FROM ConfigSettings WHERE Name='base');
    SELECT c.configID, cs.Name, cs.Label, c.value, cs.Description FROM Config c LEFT JOIN ConfigSettings cs ON (c.ConfigID = cs.ID) WHERE ConfigID=(SELECT ID FROM ConfigSettings WHERE Name='host');
   ```

2. If the values displayed by these 2 commands do not match your _$lorisRootDirectory_ and _$hostName_, update them with the following commands on the SQL command-line.

   ```sql
   UPDATE Config SET Value='$lorisRootDirectory' WHERE ConfigID=(SELECT ID FROM ConfigSettings WHERE Name='base');
   UPDATE Config SET Value='$hostName' WHERE ConfigID=(SELECT ID FROM ConfigSettings WHERE Name='host');
   ```

3. Check the base path does not have a trailing slash at the end. If it does, update its value to remove it.
4. Once the necessary changes have been made to your database, exit the MySQL backend and restart Apache before re-loading the frontend.


## Admin login issues
If you are unable to log in to LORIS with your admin user after an installation or upgrade, make sure your admin account record in the users table contains:                                                       
```  
Active = 'Y'
Pending_approval = 'N'
Password_expiry column value is later than today's date
```

You can also reset your admin password with the script [tools/resetpassword.php](https://github.com/aces/Loris/blob/master/tools/resetpassword.php).

```bash
php tools/resetpassword.php admin
```
