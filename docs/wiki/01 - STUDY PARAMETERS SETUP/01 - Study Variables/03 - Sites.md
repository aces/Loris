# Sites

## Overview
Study **Sites** or **centres** are terms used interchangeably in LORIS. **Sites** are defined in the `psc` table of the database.
   
LORIS' default schema defines the first psc (CenterID=1) as the Data Coordinating Center or #DCC#.  This site is generally used as dummy data and is assumed by the codebase to store non-study data, and so it not recommended to modify or use this site for registering real study data.

>  Note: There cannot be more than one site with the same name.
