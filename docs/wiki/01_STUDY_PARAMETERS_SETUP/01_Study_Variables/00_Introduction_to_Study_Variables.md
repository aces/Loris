# Introduction to LORIS Study Variables

## Identifiers

In LORIS, and indeed in all of its instances (CBIG, CCNA, xxx, yyy, etc), the names of participants is anonymized by assigning numeric and alphanumeric ID's to them. In this way, the data of a participant is protected from connection to their name or personal identifying information ("PII"). 

The IDs in LORIS have different purposes:

- [CandID](CandID.md)

- Cardinality: One per participant per project
- Purpose: Internal database operations

- [PSCID](PscID.md)

- Cardinality: One per participant per project
- Main participant identifier

- [ExteralID]

- Cardinality: Multiple per participant
- Data dissemination

- [Projects]
- [Sites]
- [Cohorts]
- [Timepoints]
- [Configurations]
