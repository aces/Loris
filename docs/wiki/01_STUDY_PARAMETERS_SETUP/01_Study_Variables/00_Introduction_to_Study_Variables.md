# Introduction to LORIS Study Variables

## Identifiers

In LORIS, and indeed in all of its instances, the presonal information of participant is anonymized by assigning numeric and alphanumeric ID's to them. Loris is not designed to store personal identifying information ("PII"). Rather, these identifiers are used for internal operations, like, for example,  querying data that is linked to a specific participant's ID.

The IDs in LORIS have different purposes:

- [CandID](CandID.md)

- Cardinality: One per participant per project
- Purpose: Internal database operations

- [PSCID](PscID.md)

- Cardinality: One per participant per project
- Main participant identifier

- [ExternalID]

- Cardinality: One per participant
- Data dissemination

- [Projects](02_Projects.md)
- [Sites](03_Sites.md)
- [Cohorts](04_Cohorts.md)
- [Timepoints](05_Timepoints.md)
