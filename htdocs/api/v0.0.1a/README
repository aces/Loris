This directory contains the implementation of Loris's REST API, documented in the file
../../../docs/API/LorisRESTAPI.md

Currently, basic GET support is implemented for each URL documented. Still to do:
- Comprehensive unit tests (missing Instrument Data/flags)
- PUT / PATCH method support where the behaviour is defined (missing Instrument Data/flags)
- Run the results through PHPCS


On the instrument JSON serialization, pagination needs to be implemented, support
for LINST files need to be implemented, and rules need to be implemented
