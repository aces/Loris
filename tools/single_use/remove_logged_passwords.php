This script deletes occurrences of plaintext passwords that were stored in the
`history` table.

The plaintext passwords appeared due to a bug in LORIS. As these passwords
have potentially been viewed by administrators or could be read in the event
of a data breach, we have chosen to delete them from the history table.
Additionally, users with potentially exposed passwords will be forced to
change their passwords.

// Query DB for burned passwords. The bug caused passwords to be stored on 
// update so we'll limit the query to that. Additionally we will filter out
// results from the `new` data that are password hashes i.e. those that begin
// with the $ character.
