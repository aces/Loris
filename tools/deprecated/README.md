This directory contains tools used in earlier versions of LORIS but 
have not been maintained in more recent versions. Tools remaining in 
this category for an extended period of time will be removed from 
LORIS in future iterations, if any of these tools are important to 
your project make sure to let the LORIS Team know. Tools brought 
up-to-date with the latest version and tested can be moved to other 
categories.
