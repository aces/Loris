This directory contains tools used to entirely remove data entries from 
the database. These tools should be handled with extreme care as there 
is no way to undo their effect. It is not recommended to delete data 
when it is hide-able from the front end. These are dangerous scripts and 
should only be run by someone who has tested them thoroughly.
