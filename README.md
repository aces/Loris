This Readme covers installation of the LORIS <b>v20.*</b> release on <b>Ubuntu</b>.
([CentOS Readme also available](https://github.com/aces/Loris/blob/master/README.CentOS6.md)).

Please consult the [LORIS Wiki Setup Guide](https://github.com/aces/Loris/wiki/Setup) notes on this [Install process](https://github.com/aces/Loris/wiki/Installing-Loris) for more information not included in this Readme. The [LORIS Developers mailing list](http://www.bic.mni.mcgill.ca/mailman/listinfo/loris-dev) may also provide installation guidance not covered in the Wiki. 

# Prerequisites for Installation

 * LINUX (supported on Ubuntu 14+ and [CentOS 6.5](https://github.com/aces/Loris/blob/master/README.CentOS6.md))
 * Apache2
 * MySQL 5.7 
 * PHP <b>7.2</b>  
 * Package manager (for LINUX distributions)
 * Composer : should be run with --no-dev option

<b>Important:</b>
 * If you are upgrading your LORIS, you'll also want to upgrade to both PHP 7.2 and MySQL 5.7.
 * Composer should be run with --no-dev option unless you are an active LORIS developer. 

Consult the [LORIS Wiki](https://github.com/aces/Loris/wiki/Setup) page on this [Install process](https://github.com/aces/Loris/wiki/Installing-Loris) for more information.

# Installation

1. Set up LINUX user lorisadmin and create LORIS base directory:

    ```
    sudo useradd -U -m -G sudo -s /bin/bash lorisadmin
    sudo passwd lorisadmin
    su - lorisadmin
    ```

    <b>Important ⇾ All steps from this point forward must be executed by lorisadmin user</b>

    ```
    sudo mkdir -m 775 -p /var/www/$projectname
    sudo chown lorisadmin.lorisadmin /var/www/$projectname
    ```

    <i>$projectname ⇾ "loris" or one-word project name</i>

2. Get code:
    Download the latest release from the [releases page](https://github.com/aces/Loris/releases) and
    extract it to `/var/www/$projectname`

3. Run installer script to install core code, and libraries. The script will prompt for information and so that it can create directories automatically.

    For more information, please read the [Installing Loris wiki page](https://github.com/aces/Loris/wiki/Installing-Loris).

    ```
    cd /var/www/$projectname/tools
    ./install.sh
    ```

4. Apache configuration and restart 
LORIS requires Apache's mod_rewrite module to rewrite its URLs. Enable this module, then restart Apache: 

    ```
    sudo a2enmod rewrite
    sudo service apache2 reload
    ```

5. Go to http://localhost/installdb.php and follow the instructions to finalize LORIS installation.

    _Note_: Apache config files will be installed as *.conf, per Ubuntu 14.04. If running an earlier version of Ubuntu, rename these files, then run the following commands. After, restart Apache.


    ```
    sudo a2dissite default
    sudo a2ensite $projectname
    ```

6. Follow the [Setup Guide in the LORIS Wiki](https://github.com/aces/Loris/wiki/Setup) to complete your post-installation setup and configuration, and for more documentation.
