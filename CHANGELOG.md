## CHANGELOG

***This document logs all changes to the core code or individual modules which cause a 
variation in the behaviour of the software for users. This log will be used to write 
out the final release notes at the moment of tagging a release.***

- When adding content to this document, make sure to create a section for each module 
if the changes only impact a single module and that section does not already exist in
the document. When changes affect the entire software, make sure to add them in the 
core section.

- When possible please provide the number of the pull request(s) containing the 
changes in the following format: PR #1234


### Core
