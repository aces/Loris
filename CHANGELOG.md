provided as the body of a PUT/PATCH request. The values of all fields are now defined by
the `Data` key instead of `$InstrumentName` (PR #7857)
- Run the script `tools/single_use/update_violations_resolved_hashes.sql.php` to update hashes
  for the `violations_resolved` table according to the new hashing nomenclature. Not doing so 
  will result in duplication of data in the `violations_resolved` table when users update
  a resolution status for a violation.

- The `Center_name` field in the `mri_protocol` table has been replaced by `CenterID`

- The default value of the `ScannerID` field of the `mri_protocol` table is now 
`NULL` instead of `0`. This means that if a protocol is valid on all the study's 
scanners, then `ScannerID` of the protocol should be set to `NULL` (PR #7496)


### Notes For Existing Projects
- The `RegistrationProjectID` column of the candidate table and the `ProjectID` column of the session table 
in the database are no longer nullable. This means that a value must be set in these fields BEFORE running 
the release SQL patch or it will fail.
- New function `Candidate::getSubjectForMostRecentVisit` replaces `Utility::getCohortIDUsingCandID`, 
adding the ability to determine which cohort a candidate belongs to given their most recent visit.
- LINST instrument class was modified to implement the `getFullName()` and `getSubtestList()`
functions thus making entries in the `test_names` and `instrument_subtests` tables 
unnecessary for LINST instruments (PR #7169)
- The script `tools/single_use/remove_publication_users_edit_perm_rel_duplicates.php`
should be run before upgrading LORIS. 
- The `Data_entry_completion_status` column of instrument tables has been migrated 
to its own column in the `flag` table, and renamed to `Required_elements_completed`. After script 
`Set_Required_elements_completed_flag.php` is run, projects will need to delete the 
`Data_entry_completion_status` column of instrument tables. This can be accomplished 
by running `Remove_Data_entry_completion_status_instr_column.php`, and then sourcing 
the patch generated by this script. (PR #6876)
- If `_setDataEntryCompletionStatus`, `_determineDataEntryCompletionStatus`, and/or 
`updateDataEntryCompletionStatus` are called in any overrides, make sure to replace 
all instances with their newly named counterparts, `_setRequiredElementsCompletedFlag`, 
`_determineRequiredElementsCompletedFlag`, `updateRequiredElementsCompletedFlag`. (PR #6876)
- Deprecation of `begintable` and `endtable` elements in LINST instruments (PR #7183)
- Deletion of `dateTimeFields` and `monthYearFields` variables in instrument class. 
All references to these variables should be removed from project instruments. (PR #7183)
- Visit definitions is no longer done in the `config.xml`. An importer tool (`populate_visits.php`) is 
available to import the current setup into the `visit` table of the database. 
Make sure the visits displayed after these changes are what you expect. 
The visits can be removed from the `config.xml` file after the importer tool is run. (#7663 & #7729)
- There is a new abstract `getDataDictionary()` function in the instrument class 
for the new data dictionary framework. This is already implemented for LINST instruments, 
and existing instruments using `LorisForm` can use the `\LorisFormDictionaryImpl` 
trait to extract it in the same way as `lorisform_parser.php` did for the old `datadict` module.
- The name of a Standard Date field in a LINST instrument must now end with the 
string `_date`. Otherwise, a LORIS exception is thrown. There is no restriction 
on the naming format of a Basic Date or MonthYear field. (PR #6923) 
- Run `tools/single_use/Remove_duplicate_examiners.php` to remove duplicate 
examiners that may have been created before bugfix. Make sure to run this script 
_before_ running the `SQL/New_patches/2021-09-28-Unique_examiners.sql`. (PR #7462)
- Deletion of support for the oldest version of the API (v0.0.2) (PR #6944)
- Refer to instructions for clean up scripts meant to remove unused data in the `SQL/Archive/24.0/Cleanup` directory

- JQuery cleanup (Various PRs)
- PHPCS enabled for tools/ and test/ (Various PRs)
